# Local Development Environment

HyperShell deploys the same stack (API server, control plane, web console,
Keycloak) on Kind or on an existing OpenShift cluster. Targets follow the same
shape: `make kind-<name>` or `make openshift-<name>`. Kind creates a local
cluster. OpenShift never creates a cluster; it deploys into the oc project you
select.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) | Container engine | OS package manager |
| [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) | Local Kubernetes clusters (Kind path) | `brew install kind` |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) | Kubernetes CLI (Kind path) | `brew install kubectl` |
| [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) | OpenShift CLI (OpenShift path) | [install oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) |
| [cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind) | LoadBalancer + Gateway API for Kind | `brew install cloud-provider-kind` |

The container engine is auto-detected (Podman preferred). Override with
`CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker` or `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`.

## Kind Development

Kind ([Kubernetes in Docker](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)) is the default
single-tenant path. `make kind-up` creates the cluster and deploys every
platform component so you can test changes end to end.

### Quickstart

```bash
make kind-up
```

This creates a Kind cluster and deploys:

1. Gateway API CRDs (experimental channel, includes BackendTLSPolicy)
2. cloud-provider-kind (LoadBalancer + Gateway API controller)
3. cert-manager (TLS certificate lifecycle)
4. Keycloak (OIDC identity provider)
5. Networking Gateway with wildcard TLS certificates
6. HTTPRoutes for all services
7. API server (with DB migration init container)
8. Control plane (gRPC watcher + reconciler, provisions PostgreSQL)
9. Web console (Node.js BFF + React SPA)

### Expected Output

```
=== HyperShell is running! ===

  HTTP API:      https://api.hypershell.localhost
  Web Console:   https://console.hypershell.localhost
  Health:        https://health.hypershell.localhost
  Keycloak:      https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost (admin/admin)
  OIDC Issuer:   https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell
```

Services are accessed via `.localhost` hostnames routed through the networking
Gateway. CoreDNS resolves all `*.hypershell.localhost` to loopback, and
OS-level port forwarding (pfctl on macOS, iptables on Linux) redirects
host port 443 to cloud-provider-kind's ephemeral Gateway port.
The TLS certificate is self-signed -- trust it in your browser or use
`curl --cacert`.

### Kind make targets

`make kind-up` is idempotent: running it again on an existing cluster
reapplies manifests and waits for readiness. Swapped components are preserved.

| Target | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `make kind-up` | Create the Kind cluster, install prerequisites, deploy the stack, seed sample resources, and wait until ready. |
| `make kind-down` | Remove the `hypershell-system` namespace and its resources. Leaves the Kind cluster running. |
| `make kind-teardown` | Destroy the Kind cluster and stop cloud-provider-kind. |
| `make kind-status` | Show cluster info, pods, services, and which components are swapped. |
| `make kind-seed` | Re-run ManagedCluster, GatewayRelease, and Gateway seeding. Reuses existing named seed resources (`local-kind`, `dev-release`, `dev-gateway`) instead of creating duplicates. `kind-up` already seeds unless `SKIP_SEED=true`. |
| `make kind-prereqs` | Build the pinned `cloud-provider-kind` binary into `bin/`. `kind-up` runs this; use it alone when the binary is missing. |
| `make kind-env` | Print `export` statements for the current Kind make variables. |
| `make kind-fix-ports` | Re-establish host port 443 forwarding to the Gateway's ephemeral port. |
| `make kind-gateway-trust` | Write the cluster CA to `bin/hypershell-ca.crt` and print `export SSL_CERT_FILE=...` for the openshell CLI. Run `eval "$(make kind-gateway-trust)"`. |
| `make kind-openshell ARGS="-g <name> ..."` | Run the openshell CLI in a container on Kind's own podman network instead of installing it on the host. Needed when the deployed gateway's build has no native CLI release to install (a downstream image tag, e.g. `v0.0.116-rhaiv.6`) - the matching CLI is Linux-only, so this is the way to use it from macOS. `<name>` must already be a registered gateway (`~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/`). |
| `make kind-api-server-up` | Build the API server from the working tree and swap it into the cluster. |
| `make kind-api-server-down` | Revert the API server to the baseline registry image. |
| `make kind-control-plane-up` | Build the control plane from the working tree and swap it into the cluster. |
| `make kind-control-plane-down` | Revert the control plane to the baseline registry image. |
| `make kind-web-console-up` | Hot-reload the web console (default), or build and swap a full image when `KIND_HOT_RELOAD=false`. |
| `make kind-web-console-down` | Revert the web console to the baseline registry image. |

### Per-component swap

Baseline images are pulled from the container registry. To build all baseline
images locally instead (e.g. when registry access is unavailable), run:

```bash
LOCAL_IMAGES=true make kind-up
```

To test local changes, swap individual components:

```bash
# Build and deploy API server from working tree
make kind-api-server-up

# Build and deploy control plane from working tree
make kind-control-plane-up

# Start web console with hot reload (default)
make kind-web-console-up

# Start web console with full image rebuild
KIND_HOT_RELOAD=false make kind-web-console-up
```

The web console uses hot reload by default - `kind-web-console-up` starts a
local Vite dev server and proxies through the cluster. Use
`KIND_HOT_RELOAD=false` to build and deploy a full container image instead.
API server and control plane rebuilds replace the running deployment; re-run
after making changes to pick them up.

### Revert to Baseline

```bash
make kind-api-server-down
make kind-control-plane-down
make kind-web-console-down
```

Reverts the component to the registry baseline image. No-op if the component
is already running the baseline.

### Swap Status

```bash
make kind-status
```

Shows which components are running local builds vs. baseline images. Swap state
is tracked in `.kind-swaps` (gitignored).

### Hot reload

The web console supports hot reload by default. When you run
`make kind-web-console-up`, the host source directory is mounted into the
container and `npm run dev` runs in development mode. File changes on the host
are reflected immediately without rebuilding.

To disable hot reload and use a full image rebuild instead:

```bash
KIND_HOT_RELOAD=false make kind-web-console-up
```

Hot reload is only supported for the web console. The API server and control
plane are Go services that require a full rebuild (`make kind-api-server-up` /
`make kind-control-plane-up`).

### Keycloak

The local Keycloak instance mirrors the downstream Keycloak topology used in
production.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Realm | `hypershell` |
| Frontend client | `hypershell-frontend` (public, standard flow + direct access grants) |
| CLI client | `hypershell-cli` (public, standard flow + device authorization grant, used by `hsctl login`) |
| Provisioner client | `hypershell-provisioner` (confidential, service account) |
| Control plane client | `hypershell-control-plane` (confidential, service account, client_credentials) |
| Admin user | `admin` / `admin` (roles: `hypershell-admins`, `platform:admin`, `gateway:creator`) |
| Developer user | `developer` / `developer` (role: `hypershell-users`) |
| OIDC Issuer URL | `https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell` |
| Admin Console | `https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/admin/` |

Dashboard-operator access (operational dashboard, user inventory, managed
inventory metrics) requires the `platform:admin` Keycloak realm role, which is
JWT-synced to a `platform:admin` RoleBinding. The legacy `hypershell-admins`
group alone does not grant dashboard access.

### OIDC

Keycloak is configured with `KC_HOSTNAME=https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost`,
which pins the OIDC issuer and all frontend URLs to HTTPS on port 443 --
matching production's issuer form. Keycloak itself stays plain HTTP internally
(`KC_HTTP_PORT=8080`, `KC_PROXY_HEADERS=xforwarded`); the networking Gateway
terminates TLS on its `*.hypershell.localhost` :443 listener with the
cert-manager cert and forwards to `keycloak-service:8080`. The same OIDC issuer
URL works from both the host browser and in-cluster pods: cluster CoreDNS is
patched to resolve `*.hypershell.localhost` (including `keycloak`) to the
Gateway LB IP, so pods reach the issuer through the same HTTPS listener. Gateway
pods trust the self-signed CA via the `gateway-trusted-ca` ConfigMap
(`SSL_CERT_FILE`), which `make kind-up` publishes from the `hypershell-https-tls`
secret.

The control plane authenticates to the API server's gRPC endpoint using its own
Keycloak service account (`hypershell-control-plane` client, confidential,
`client_credentials` grant). `make kind-up` creates a `hypershell-cp-oidc`
secret and patches the control plane deployment with `OIDC_ISSUER`,
`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. When swapped locally, export those
variables in your shell before running the control plane binary.

Port forwarding (pfctl/iptables) maps host port 443 to the Gateway's ephemeral
HTTPS port. If port forwarding is not active (e.g. after a cluster restart),
re-establish it with:

```bash
make kind-fix-ports
```

Verify the OIDC discovery endpoint (the cert is self-signed, hence `--cacert`
or `-k`):

```bash
curl --cacert <(kubectl --context kind-hypershell-dev get secret hypershell-https-tls \
  -n hypershell-system -o go-template='{{index .data "ca.crt" | base64decode}}') \
  https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

### External Keycloak

To test against a shared downstream Keycloak instead of the local instance:

```bash
KIND_KEYCLOAK_URL=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/hypershell make kind-up
```

This skips the local Keycloak deployment and points the gateway OIDC issuer at
the external URL.

### OIDC authentication

The Kind cluster runs with OIDC authentication enabled. Keycloak is deployed as
the identity provider and all components are configured for JWT validation and
session management during `make kind-up`.

### Browser login flow

1. Navigate to `https://console.hypershell.localhost`
2. The BFF redirects to `https://console.hypershell.localhost/auth/login`
3. The login page redirects to Keycloak for authentication
4. Sign in with `admin`/`admin` or `developer`/`developer`
5. Keycloak redirects back to the web console with a valid session

### hsctl login (management API)

Build the CLI with `make build-cli`, then authenticate against the Kind cluster:

```bash
./components/cli/hsctl login \
  --url https://api.hypershell.localhost \
  --issuer-url https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell \
  --insecure
```

For headless environments, add `--no-browser` to use the device authorization flow.
The CLI stores tokens in `~/.config/hypershell/config.json` (or `~/.hypershell.json`
if that legacy path already exists) and uses the `hypershell-cli` Keycloak client.

Check identity with `hsctl whoami` and log out with `hsctl logout`.

### Hot reload and OIDC

Web console hot reload (`make kind-web-console-up`) runs the Vite dev server
directly on the host for fast iteration. This mode does **not** start the BFF,
so OIDC authentication is unavailable during hot reload. Use the image-based
swap when testing OIDC:

```bash
KIND_HOT_RELOAD=false make kind-web-console-up
```

### CLI token acquisition for curl testing

Obtain an access token via Keycloak's direct access grants:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -sk -X POST \
  "https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=hypershell-frontend" \
  -d "username=admin" \
  -d "password=admin" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  https://api.hypershell.localhost/api/hypershell/v1/gateways
```

### Private registry pull secret

If your baseline images live in a private registry, provide a pull secret:

```bash
PULL_SECRET=/path/to/pull-secret.yaml make kind-up
```

`KIND_PULL_SECRET` is still accepted as an alias. The YAML file is applied into
the target namespace with `kubectl apply`. It should contain a
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret. OpenShift component swaps use the
same file to log the container engine into `SWAP_REGISTRY`.

### Offline development

Build all component images from the local working tree instead of pulling from
the container registry:

```bash
LOCAL_IMAGES=true make kind-up
```

This builds api-server, control-plane, and web-console images locally and loads
them into Kind. The Dockerfiles drop the local `rh-trex-ai` replace directive at
build time, so no external dependency checkout is needed.

### Kind environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` | `hypershell-dev` | Kind cluster name |
| `KIND_NAMESPACE` | `hypershell-system` | Target namespace for swap and teardown |
| `KIND_HOT_RELOAD` | `true` | Hot reload for the web console |

## OpenShift Development

`make openshift-up` deploys the same stack into the current oc project on an
OpenShift cluster selected by kubeconfig. It does not create the cluster. An
administrator must already have provisioned the shared Gateway, GatewayClass,
certificate issuer, and wildcard certificate (see
`deploy/openshift/infrastructure/GATEWAY-SETUP.md`).

### OpenShift quickstart

The platform namespace is the current oc project. Select it first, then bring
the environment up:

```bash
oc project alice
make openshift-up
```

`OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` overrides that project when you need to target a
namespace other than the one `oc project -q` reports:

```bash
OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE=alice make openshift-up
```

The name must be a valid RFC 1123 DNS label of at most 54 characters so the
companion Keycloak namespace `${name}-keycloak` stays within the 63-character
limit. If no project is selected and `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` is unset, the
command stops with an error.

### OpenShift make targets

| Target | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `make openshift-up` | Deploy the stack into the current oc project (`OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` override) and companion `${name}-keycloak`. Does not create an OpenShift cluster. Waits for component rollouts, then seeds unless `SKIP_SEED=true`. |
| `make openshift-down` | Delete the platform and Keycloak projects, then delete gateway namespaces labeled `hypershell.redhat.io/instance=<platform ns>`. If project deletion is forbidden, strip HyperShell resources and leave the projects. Without ownership labels the command refuses; `FORCE=true make openshift-down` overrides that check. Reserved names (`default`, `kube-*`, `openshift-*`) stay refused. |
| `make openshift-teardown` | Same as `openshift-down`. There is no OpenShift cluster to destroy. |
| `make openshift-status` | Show namespaces, pods, Routes, the shared Gateway, and swap state. |
| `make openshift-seed` | Re-run ManagedCluster, GatewayRelease, and Gateway seeding via API and Keycloak Routes from this machine. Reuses existing named seed resources (`local-openshift`, `dev-release`, `dev-gateway`) instead of creating duplicates. `openshift-up` already seeds unless `SKIP_SEED=true`. |
| `make openshift-api-server-up` | Build, push an immutable image to `SWAP_REGISTRY`, and point the API server Deployment at that ref. Requires `SWAP_REGISTRY`. |
| `make openshift-api-server-down` | Revert the API server to the baseline registry image. |
| `make openshift-control-plane-up` | Build, push, and swap the control plane. |
| `make openshift-control-plane-down` | Revert the control plane to the baseline registry image. |
| `make openshift-web-console-up` | Build, push, and swap the web console. There is no Kind-style Vite hot reload. |
| `make openshift-web-console-down` | Revert the web console to the baseline registry image. |
| `make openshift-test` | Run `scripts/cluster/lib_test.sh` on the laptop (overlay rewrite tests). Does not talk to a cluster. |

`make openshift-up` deploys into the project you selected. It does not ask
for confirmation, and it does not require permission to label the namespace.
When the account can patch namespaces, the scripts stamp HyperShell ownership
labels. When it cannot, the scripts warn and continue. Namespaces that already
belong to a different HyperShell environment, and reserved names (`default`,
`kube-*`, `openshift-*`), are still refused.

The companion Keycloak project `${name}-keycloak` is created with
`oc new-project` when it does not exist (developers can ProjectRequest; they
typically cannot `oc create namespace`). The scripts switch to that project to
apply Keycloak, then switch back to the platform project for the rest of the
stack. OpenShift's default project NetworkPolicies only allow ingress from the
same namespace and from `openshift-ingress`, so the overlay also applies
`keycloak-allow-platform` in the Keycloak project. That policy lets the API
server load JWKS and the control plane call the Admin API over the in-cluster
Service.

This renders `kustomize build deploy/openshift/`, maps `hypershell-system` to
that platform namespace and `keycloak` to `${platform}-keycloak`, applies the
overlay ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding with names prefixed
`${namespace}-dev-*` (so an environment does not patch stage's
`hypershell-controller`), plus the privileged SCC RoleBinding, applies the
manifests (with prune scoped to this environment), registers the web-console
Route as the Keycloak `hypershell-frontend` redirect URI, seeds a
ManagedCluster, GatewayRelease, and Gateway from this machine
against the API and Keycloak Routes (the API server image has no `curl`), and
prints the API, web-console, and Keycloak Routes. The overlay sets
`API_ENV=development_oidc` on the API server so `--enable-jwt=true` is not
clobbered by the default `development` environment. Route-derived OIDC values
(`KC_HOSTNAME`, console redirect URIs, gateway issuer) are applied after the
Routes exist. The gateway base domain is
read from the shared Gateway's listener hostname, not from
`GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN`. When ClusterRole create is forbidden, the command
binds `${namespace}-dev-hypershell-controller` to the existing cluster-wide
ClusterRole `hypershell-controller` if that ClusterRole exists. Only if that
fallback also fails does it warn and continue. It never applies unprefixed
`hypershell-controller`. `make openshift-down` deletes this environment's
`${namespace}-dev-*` ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings and does not delete
stage's `hypershell-controller`.

`make openshift-down` and `make openshift-teardown` are the same command.
There is no OpenShift cluster to destroy. Both delete the platform project
and the companion `${name}-keycloak` project. If project deletion is
forbidden, they delete HyperShell resources inside both projects (including
unlabeled Keycloak) and leave the projects. Labels are not required.

### OpenShift per-component swap

```bash
make openshift-api-server-up
make openshift-control-plane-up
make openshift-web-console-up
```

Each swap builds from the working tree, pushes an immutable image (commit +
namespace tag) to `SWAP_REGISTRY`, and updates the Deployment image refs to
the registry digest from that push (not the local image digest). Images are
built for the OpenShift node architecture (`SWAP_PLATFORM`, or detected from
the cluster) via `--platform linux/<arch>`. Component Dockerfiles pin HI bases
per architecture. `SWAP_REGISTRY` is the org prefix only (`quay.io/<org>`). Repo
names default to `hypershell-api-server`, `hypershell-controller`, and
`hypershell-web-console`; set `SWAP_REPOSITORY` to override the repo for the
current swap. `SWAP_REGISTRY` is required; swaps do not use `IMAGE_REGISTRY`.
Matching `-down` targets revert to the baseline registry image. Registry
login uses `PULL_SECRET` (`KIND_PULL_SECRET` still works). `make openshift-status`
reports which components run a working-tree build and the exact image each
one uses. Swap state is tracked per namespace in `.openshift-swaps/`
(gitignored). A subsequent `make openshift-up` preserves active swaps.

### OpenShift environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` | `oc project -q` | Override for the platform namespace. Unset, the current oc project is used. Max 54 chars; Keycloak lands in `${name}-keycloak`. |
| `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAME` | `openshell-grpc-gateway` | Pre-existing shared Gateway name |
| `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` | `openshift-ingress` | Namespace of the shared Gateway |
| `SWAP_REGISTRY` | (required for swaps) | Registry org prefix only, for example `quay.io/<org>`. Swaps push `${SWAP_REGISTRY}/hypershell-api-server` (and `hypershell-controller`, `hypershell-web-console`). Must be laptop-reachable; the OpenShift internal registry is refused. `IMAGE_REGISTRY` is not used. |
| `SWAP_REPOSITORY` | (component default) | Optional repo name override for the current swap. Default is `hypershell-api-server`, `hypershell-controller`, or `hypershell-web-console`. |
| `SWAP_PLATFORM` | (cluster nodes) | Target platform for swap images, `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`. Unset, the scripts use the architecture of the cluster nodes. |
| `PULL_SECRET` | (unset) | Path to a `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret YAML used to log the container engine into `SWAP_REGISTRY`. `KIND_PULL_SECRET` is still accepted. |
| `IMAGE_REGISTRY` | `quay.io/redhat-services-prod/hcm-eng-prod-tenant/hypershell-main` | Container registry for baseline images |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | `latest` | Image tag for baseline images |
| `CONTAINER_ENGINE` | Auto-detected | `podman` or `docker` |
| `SKIP_SEED` | (unset) | Set to `true` to skip seeding on `make openshift-up`. `KIND_SKIP_SEED` is still accepted. |
| `SEED_STRICT` | (unset) | Set to `true` to fail `make openshift-up` / `make openshift-seed` if seeding is incomplete. `KIND_SEED_STRICT` is still accepted. |

## Gateway Access

The control plane provisions openshell-gateway pods that serve gRPC over TLS
using cert-manager-issued certificates. Accessing these gateways from the host
depends on the environment.

### Kind (port-forward)

In Kind, the simplest method is `kubectl port-forward`. This connects directly
to the gateway pod's TLS endpoint, bypassing the networking Gateway entirely:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-hypershell-dev port-forward \
  -n <gateway-namespace> svc/openshell-gateway 7443:8080 &
```

Then register the gateway with the openshell CLI:

```bash
openshell gateway add \
  --name my-gateway \
  --oidc-issuer https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell \
  --oidc-client-id hypershell-frontend \
  https://localhost:7443
```

This opens a browser for Keycloak login. Use `admin`/`admin` or
`developer`/`developer`.

The OIDC issuer URL **must** be
`https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell` (not the ephemeral
port). Keycloak embeds this URL as the `iss` claim in tokens, so the issuer
passed to `openshell gateway add` must match exactly. This requires host port
443 to be forwarded -- if it isn't, run `make kind-fix-ports` first.

The legacy OpenShift e2e script (`components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`) uses the
same port-forward fallback when no passthrough route is available. That script is
**deprecated** (see `specs/platform/ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`): the
canonical pull-request OpenShift e2e path is the shared harness
`tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` run with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift`, driven
automatically by the ephemeral pull-request environment workflow (see
[Ephemeral OpenShift PR environments](#ephemeral-openshift-pr-environments)).
Prefer the shared harness for new work; the IBM ROKS variant
(`e2e-openshell-roks.sh`) is unaffected.

### OpenShift (automatic)

On OpenShift, the control plane automatically creates networking resources when
a gateway has `Route.Enabled` set:

1. A per-namespace **Gateway** with `openshift-default` gateway class
2. A **GRPCRoute** routing to `openshell-gateway:8080`
3. A **BackendTLSPolicy** for TLS re-encryption to the backend (the OpenShift
   router terminates external TLS, then re-encrypts to the pod using the
   gateway's cert-manager CA)
4. A **NetworkPolicy** allowing ingress from `openshift-ingress` router pods

The gateway becomes reachable at
`grpcs://<openshell-gateway-NAMESPACE>.<GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN>:443` with no
port-forward needed. The control plane writes this address back to the API
server's `route_address` field.

### Gateway TLS in Kind

The networking Gateway's `*.gw.localhost` listener uses TLS Terminate mode,
which strips the external TLS and forwards plaintext to the backend.
openshell-gateway pods expect TLS connections (they serve gRPC with their own
cert-manager certificates). BackendTLSPolicy instructs the gateway
implementation to re-encrypt traffic to the backend. The `kind-prereqs` target
builds cloud-provider-kind from a fork that adds BackendTLSPolicy support,
so per-tenant gateways work without port-forward workarounds.

### Creating a gateway with OIDC

`make kind-up` seeds ManagedCluster and GatewayRelease but does not create a
Gateway. The gateway database server needs no API resource: the control plane
reads the `hypershell-gateway-database-admin` Secret that `kind-up` creates.
Create a Gateway via the API:

```bash
# Get the seeded resource IDs
CLUSTER_ID=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/hypershell/v1/managed_clusters | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['items'][0]['id'])")
RELEASE_ID=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/hypershell/v1/gateway_releases | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['items'][0]['id'])")

# Create a gateway with OIDC
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/hypershell/v1/gateways \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"dev-gateway\",
    \"cluster_id\": \"${CLUSTER_ID}\",
    \"release_id\": \"${RELEASE_ID}\",
    \"oidc\": \"{\\\"issuer\\\":\\\"https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell\\\",\\\"audience\\\":\\\"hypershell-frontend\\\",\\\"roles_claim\\\":\\\"groups\\\",\\\"admin_role\\\":\\\"hypershell-admins\\\",\\\"user_role\\\":\\\"hypershell-users\\\"}\"
  }"
```

Wait ~30s for the control plane to reconcile, then port-forward and register.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Run the full local unit test suite (API server, control plane, CLI/SDK
generators, frontend packages, and shell tests) before pushing:

```bash
make unit-test-all
```

| Target | Runs |
|--------|------|
| `make unit-test-all` | Every unit test suite: `install-js`, `make ci-test`, `components/api-server` (`make test`), `components/control-plane` (`go test ./...`), `components/cli`, `scripts/cli-generator`, `scripts/sdk-generator` (`go test ./...`), and `pnpm run test:web` (frontend packages) |
| `make ci-test` | Only the auto-discovered `*_test.sh` shell unit tests (see below) |

Component-scoped runs are also available:

```bash
cd components/api-server && make test              # Go tests (spins up PostgreSQL via testcontainers-go; requires Docker/Podman)
cd components/api-server && make test-integration   # Same, scoped to ./plugins/...
cd components/control-plane && go test ./...        # Go unit tests
```

Shell unit tests (`*_test.sh`, e.g. `scripts/kind/lib_test.sh`) are
auto-discovered by `make ci-test` and `scripts/run-shell-unit-tests.sh` -
adding a new `*_test.sh` file next to the script it tests is enough; no
Makefile or CI allowlist update is needed.

### CI

Two independently-triggered, top-level workflows run on every pull request,
push to `main`, and merge-queue entry: `.github/workflows/checks.yml`
(static/whole-repo checks) and `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (unit tests and
e2e). They each show as their own entry in the PR checks list and run fully
concurrently - GitHub Actions `needs:` only orders jobs within one workflow
file, so the two cannot gate each other without a cross-workflow poller,
which this repo deliberately avoids. Each therefore runs its own
`detect-changes` job rather than sharing one.

`.github/workflows/checks.yml` covers per-component lint jobs, repository
policy (`make check`, unconditional), and OpenAPI SDK drift (gated on the
sdk_go/sdk_typescript detection outputs) - all sharing that workflow's single
`detect-changes` pass instead of each re-detecting changes on their own
trigger the way the old standalone `repository-policy.yml` and
`sdk-drift-check.yml` did. Its `checks-gate` job (`Checks CI Gate`) runs
with `if: always()`, reads every other job's rolled-up result, and fails
unless `detect-changes` succeeded and no job failed or was cancelled (a
path-filtered skip still passes the gate).

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` detects changed components once (its
`detect-changes` job) and calls unit and e2e as reusable workflows, passing
the detection results in as inputs and wiring the stages with native
`needs:` edges: `unit` depends only on `detect-changes`, and `e2e` joins on
`unit` (`needs: [detect-changes, unit]`). GitHub Actions skips a job by
default if any needed job failed *or was skipped*, so `e2e` also carries an
explicit `if: ${{ !cancelled() && needs.detect-changes.result == 'success'
&& needs.unit.result != 'failure' }}` - without it, a PR touching only
e2e-owned paths (every `unit` job path-filtered away, so the `unit` caller
job itself resolves to `skipped`) would silently skip `e2e` too. e2e is the
expensive stage - it provisions Kind and runs the full test matrix - so
gating it behind the cheap unit stage means Kind is never created for a SHA
whose unit tests failed, and such a failure shows up as a clean red `Tests
CI Gate` check instead of a misleading e2e environment failure. Nothing
sits polling for a preceding gate. `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml` runs
the same suites as `make unit-test-all`, split into per-component jobs that
only run when their inputs changed.

`.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s `tests-gate` job (`Tests CI Gate`) covers
the `unit` and `e2e` stages together, since they're both "running the code"
stages as opposed to `checks.yml`'s static checks. Each stage's jobs appear
as `Unit / <job>` and `E2E / <job>` checks, so there is no single check
named just `Unit`/`E2E`; the gate rolls both up into one always-present
required check the same way `checks.yml`'s gate does.

The two gate jobs are named distinctly (`Checks CI Gate`, `Tests CI Gate`)
rather than both plain `CI Gate`: this repo's branch protection is a
ruleset whose `required_status_checks` match by `(context name,
integration_id)` only, not by workflow file, and both workflows' checks
share the same "GitHub Actions" integration_id - identically-named gates
from the two workflows would be indistinguishable to the ruleset, and
either one succeeding could satisfy the requirement while the other
silently failed. Mark both `Checks CI Gate` and `Tests CI Gate` as required
checks in branch protection. Note the trade-off of running the two
workflows concurrently: a lint/policy/drift failure in `checks.yml` no
longer blocks `tests.yml`'s e2e stage from spinning up Kind - only a
unit-test failure does.

On origin pull requests whose e2e-relevant paths changed, the e2e stage
also runs `Tests / E2E / Deploy OpenShift Environment` and
`Tests / E2E / OpenShift` against a per-PR namespace on the shared CI
cluster. That cycle is ephemeral by default. See
[Ephemeral OpenShift PR environments](#ephemeral-openshift-pr-environments)
for `/pr-extend` and `/pr-destroy`.

### E2E tests

See `specs/platform/e2e-testing.spec.md` for the e2e and performance test
suites (`make e2e`, `make e2e-performance`), which run against Kind or an
existing OpenShift cluster. Origin pull-request OpenShift e2e is the
ephemeral PR environment described below.

## Ephemeral OpenShift PR environments

Origin pull requests that change e2e-relevant paths get a live OpenShift
environment on the shared CI cluster. CI deploys into
`hypershell-ci-pr-<number>` (Keycloak in
`hypershell-ci-pr-<number>-keycloak`), runs Tests / E2E / OpenShift
against it, then destroys the environment in the same run unless you opt
in. Fork pull requests and merge-queue entries do not get an environment.

`Tests / E2E / Deploy OpenShift Environment` posts one marked comment on
the pull request and updates it in place. When the environment is ready,
that comment has the namespaces, OpenShift console URL, API URL,
web-console URL, and an `oc login --web` template. Log in through the web
console with your GitHub account; you must be a member of the configured
organization or on its allowlist.

### Keep or destroy the environment

By default the environment is destroyed once e2e testing concludes,
including on a failed or cancelled run. The marked access comment then
updates in place to say the environment is gone and to comment `/pr-extend`
to redeploy it. To keep the environment as a debug target instead, comment
`/pr-extend` on the pull request. The command must start the
comment body. Trailing text is allowed:

```
/pr-extend
```

```
/pr-extend keep this up so I can inspect the failing gateway
```

`/pr-extend` requires write, maintain, or admin permission on the origin
repository. It adds the `pr-environment/pr-extended` label, deploys (or
redeploys) the current head if nothing is up, and skips in-run teardown
on later commits. You do not need to comment `/pr-extend` again after
each push.

To free a retained environment early and return the pull request to the
ephemeral default:

```
/pr-destroy
```

Closing or merging the pull request also tears the environment down,
whether or not it was retained.

The latest authorized command wins. If you comment `/pr-extend`, then
`/pr-destroy`, then `/pr-extend` again, the pull request stays retained.
A comment from someone without write access is acknowledged and ignored;
it does not flip the state.

A retained environment is renewed on every commit and reclaimed after 72
hours of inactivity unless you `/pr-destroy` or close the pull request.
The access comment shows that UTC expiry. Unretained deploys that miss
in-run teardown are reaped after 6 hours.

See `specs/platform/ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` for the full
contract.

## Troubleshooting

### Container engine not running

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon
```

Start Docker Desktop or Podman:
```bash
# Docker
open -a Docker
# Podman
podman machine start
```

### Image pull failures

If the container registry is unreachable, use offline mode:
```bash
LOCAL_IMAGES=true make kind-up
```

### cloud-provider-kind not found

```bash
make kind-prereqs
```

### DNS resolution not working

`make kind-up` runs a CoreDNS container (`hypershell-dns`) for wildcard
`*.hypershell.localhost` resolution. If hostnames don't resolve:
```bash
# Check if the DNS container is running
docker ps --filter name=hypershell-dns

# Restart it
docker restart hypershell-dns

# Verify resolution
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5553 api.hypershell.localhost
```

### OIDC discovery fails

```
Authentication failed: error sending request for url (https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/...)
```

Host port 443 is not forwarded to the Gateway's ephemeral HTTPS port, or the
gateway pod does not trust the self-signed CA. Re-establish port forwarding:

```bash
make kind-fix-ports
```

If the gateway logs a TLS/certificate error, confirm the `gateway-trusted-ca`
ConfigMap exists in `hypershell-system` (published from `hypershell-https-tls`
by `make kind-up`); the reconciler mounts it into each gateway as
`SSL_CERT_FILE`.

If you see an issuer mismatch error, you are likely using the ephemeral port
directly instead of port 443. The OIDC issuer URL must always be
`https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost/realms/hypershell` because Keycloak
embeds that URL in the token's `iss` claim.

### Keycloak admin console redirect loop

If the Keycloak admin console (`/admin/`) redirects in a loop, verify that the
`KC_HOSTNAME` env var patched by `deploy/kind/kustomization.yaml` is set to
`https://keycloak.hypershell.localhost`. Restart the Keycloak deployment
after changes:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-hypershell-dev rollout restart deployment/keycloak -n keycloak
```

### Pods stuck in ImagePullBackOff

The baseline images require access to `quay.io`. If behind a firewall, use
offline mode or configure a pull secret:
```bash
# Offline: build from local working tree
LOCAL_IMAGES=true make kind-up

# Or: provide registry credentials
PULL_SECRET=/path/to/pull-secret.yaml make kind-up
```

### OpenShift swap cannot push

Swaps build on the laptop and push to `SWAP_REGISTRY`, then update the
Deployment image refs. They do not use `IMAGE_REGISTRY` or the OpenShift
internal registry. If `SWAP_REGISTRY` is unset, the swap stops with an error.

```bash
PULL_SECRET=/path/to/pull-secret.yaml SWAP_REGISTRY=quay.io/<org> make openshift-api-server-up
```

That logs the container engine in with the pull secret and pushes
`quay.io/<org>/hypershell-api-server:<commit>-<namespace>`. Override the repo
name with `SWAP_REPOSITORY` when it is not the default. `KIND_PULL_SECRET` is
still accepted if `PULL_SECRET` is unset.
