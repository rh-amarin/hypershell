# HyperShell architecture atlas

This directory contains the canonical Markdown and Mermaid sources for the
HyperShell architecture site. The generated HTML is intentionally not checked
in: CI builds it into `dist/architecture` and deploys that artifact to GitHub
Pages.

Start with the [source atlas](./source/index.md), or build the complete site
locally to view the rendered diagrams.

## Rendering approach

Each page contains:

- an inline SVG rendered from Mermaid syntax with
  [`beautiful-mermaid`](https://github.com/lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid), the
  open-source renderer behind Craft's
  [`agents.craft.do/mermaid`](https://agents.craft.do/mermaid) page;
- the Mermaid source in a collapsible **View Mermaid source** section; and
- a citation to the repository specification or component documentation that
  defines the view.

This keeps the pages usable as ordinary static files: they do not need a
JavaScript runtime, a Mermaid server, or the HyperShell application to render.
To revise a drawing, copy its source into the
[Craft Mermaid editor](https://agents.craft.do/mermaid/editor), update the
source, rebuild the site, and preserve the source citation.

## Build locally

From the repository root:

```shell
pnpm run check:architecture
pnpm run build:architecture
python3 -m http.server 9876 --directory dist/architecture
```

Then open <http://localhost:9876/>. The `Architecture site` GitHub Actions
workflow publishes the generated `dist/architecture` directory to the
repository's GitHub Pages site after changes land on `main`.

The pages intentionally describe the current repository architecture, including
configuration-selected alternatives such as `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE`. They are documentation artifacts, not a replacement for
the authoritative specifications cited within them.
