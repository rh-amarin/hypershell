# E2E Testing and CI Integration

**Date:** 2026-08-10
**Status:** Draft
**Jira:** HYPERSHELL-18
**Related:** `local-development.spec.md` -- Kind cluster setup and the shared `scripts/cluster/` lifecycle dispatcher;
             `openshift-development.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-44) -- `make openshift-*` lifecycle, blessed `deploy/openshift/` overlay, cluster infrastructure bootstrap (this spec owns the e2e driver interface and the OpenShift e2e driver; that spec owns bring-up);
             `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-240) -- automated OpenShift pull-request CI, GitHub-brokered grant path, and `e2e-openshell.sh` deprecation;
             `ephemeral-test-credentials.spec.md` -- test-tier Keycloak users, CI-owned de-seed via `de_seed_test_users`, and static local seeds;
             `control-plane.spec.md` -- reconciler behavior;
             `openshell-gateway-routing.spec.md` -- GRPCRoute provisioning;
             `openshell-gateway-namespace-gc.spec.md` -- gateway deletion + namespace GC;
             `openshell-gateway-sandbox-count.spec.md` -- active sandbox count accounting

## Purpose

HyperShell requires infrastructure-agnostic end-to-end testing that validates the full provisioning path: API creation of a Gateway, control plane reconciliation, gateway pod readiness, route connectivity, and sandbox lifecycle. The same test suite SHALL run against Kind (local development, CI, and the merge-queue gate) and OpenShift (manual on-demand runs, and origin pull-request environments specified in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`) with infrastructure-specific logic isolated into driver scripts. A Kind CI workflow SHALL execute these tests automatically on pull requests that modify e2e-relevant components.

The existing e2e test (`components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`) validates 6 areas -- gateway provisioning, infrastructure verification, route discovery, connectivity, sandbox lifecycle, and sandbox interaction -- but is hardcoded for OpenShift. This spec defines the driver abstraction, CI workflow, and deploy restructuring required to run the same tests across multiple infrastructure targets.

HyperShell also needs a **performance test**. The performance test measures how the platform behaves under scale. It provisions a large fleet of gateways on the target cluster. It then runs the functional e2e suite to confirm the platform still works correctly under that load. The performance test reuses the same driver abstraction, so it runs against Kind for local checks and against any OpenShift cluster for on-demand load tests (see [Performance Testing](#performance-testing)).

### Scope

This spec covers the **e2e driver interface contract** (for all targets), the **Kind driver**, the **OpenShift e2e driver**, the **Kind-based CI workflow**, and the **infra-agnostic performance test**.

This spec owns the driver interface contract and the **OpenShift e2e driver** (`tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh`) so a user can run `make e2e` and `make e2e-performance` **manually** against any OpenShift cluster the user is already logged in to (via `oc login`) -- the target environment for scale and performance testing. Bring-up is a precondition: `make openshift-up` (specified in `openshift-development.spec.md`) deploys the blessed `deploy/openshift/` overlay into the current `oc` project (`OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` overrides), companion `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak`, and the per-environment `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-dev-*` cluster-scoped RBAC. This spec does not duplicate that lifecycle. Automated OpenShift pull-request CI is specified in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-240). The deprecation window for `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh` is specified there as well.

Manual OpenShift e2e and performance runs remain in scope here. Kind CI, including the merge-queue gate, remains in scope here. The OpenShift pull-request *environment* (bring-up, image swap, access comment, reaping) is specified in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`. The Tests / E2E / OpenShift job that runs the suite against that environment lives in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` and is specified here as an additional job of the CI E2E Workflow.

## Architecture

```

The driver model separates test logic from infrastructure mechanics. The main test script calls a fixed set of driver functions; each driver implements those functions for its target infrastructure. Adding a new infrastructure target requires only a new driver file.

### Driver Interface

Each driver exports shell functions that abstract infrastructure-specific operations. The table maps each function to the OpenShift-specific construct it replaces in the current `e2e-openshell.sh`:

| Function | Purpose | Kind Implementation | OpenShift Implementation |
|----------|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `discover_api_host` | Find the HyperShell API server URL | HTTPRoute hostname `api.hypershell.localhost` or port-forward to `svc/hypershell-api-server` | `oc get route hypershell-api -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'` |
| `discover_console_host` | Find the HyperShell web console (BFF) URL | HTTPRoute hostname `console.hypershell.localhost` | `oc get route hypershell-web-console -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`. Not derivable from `discover_api_host`'s result by string substitution -- Route hostnames are cluster-generated and unrelated to each other |
| `discover_gateway_endpoint` | Find the gateway gRPC endpoint | GRPCRoute hostname `<gw-name>.gw.localhost` via Gateway status address | GRPCRoute hostname via shared Gateway `Programmed=True` (Gateway API, not a per-gateway Route) |
| `get_cluster_domain` | Get the base domain for constructing gateway DNS names | `gw.localhost` (static, matching `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` in `deploy/kind/`) | Gateway base domain derived from the shared Gateway listener hostname -- the same value `make openshift-up` sets on the control plane. Not a developer-supplied `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN`, and not the cluster apps domain |
| `get_cli_binary` | Return the Kubernetes CLI binary path | `kubectl` | `oc` |
| `wait_for_gateway_route` | Block until the gateway is externally reachable | Check Gateway API Gateway status conditions and GRPCRoute parent status | Check Gateway `Programmed=True` and GRPCRoute parent `Accepted=True` |
| `acquire_oidc_token` | Obtain an OIDC access token for a given user, stored in `_OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN` for `api_curl` to use | Resource-owner password grant against Keycloak at `keycloak.hypershell.localhost`, trusting the Kind self-signed CA (`curl -k`) | Grant-agnostic against the HyperShell Keycloak at its Route in the `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` namespace, in the `hypershell` realm, trusting the cluster CA. Manual OpenShift defaults to the resource-owner password grant against seeded users. GitHub-brokered pull-request environments set `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials` as `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` defines |
| `api_curl` | Issue an authenticated HTTP request to the HyperShell API, adding the bearer token from `acquire_oidc_token` | `curl` with the bearer header against the discovered API host, trusting the Kind CA | `curl` with the bearer header against the API Route host, trusting the cluster CA |
| `assign_gateway_client_role` | Grant a user a role on a gateway's per-gateway OIDC client (mirrors the `gateway:viewer` RoleBinding); idempotent | Keycloak admin API assigns the client role in the `hypershell` realm | HyperShell Keycloak admin API (at its Route in the `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` namespace) assigns the client role in the `hypershell` realm |
| `assign_realm_role` | Grant a user a platform-wide realm role, for example `platform:admin`; idempotent | Keycloak admin API assigns the realm role | HyperShell Keycloak admin API (at its Route in the `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` namespace) assigns the realm role in the `hypershell` realm |
| `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` | Acquire a per-gateway OIDC token and block until the named role lands in it (roles reconcile asynchronously after gateway create); sets `_OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Password grant against the per-gateway client, polling until the role appears | Grant-agnostic against the per-gateway client on the HyperShell Keycloak at its Route, polling until the role appears. Manual OpenShift defaults to the password grant. GitHub-brokered pull-request environments obtain developer tokens by token-exchange impersonation of the seeded developer principal, and admin per-gateway tokens by token-exchange of the `hypershell-e2e` service account targeting that gateway client (`ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`) |
| `configure_namespace_gc_timing` | Temporarily shorten the controller's namespace-GC interval/grace period for the duration of a long-mode run, so the orphan-GC assertion (area 11a) doesn't have to wait out production timing; blocks until the resulting rollout completes | `kubectl set env deployment/hypershell-controller` in the Kind namespace, then wait for rollout | `oc set env deployment/hypershell-controller` in `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE`, then wait for rollout |
| `restore_namespace_gc_timing` | Revert the override applied by `configure_namespace_gc_timing`, restoring the deployment's configured (production) defaults; a no-op if never patched | Same mechanism as `configure_namespace_gc_timing`, in reverse; the suite cleanup trap always calls it, including on failure | Same mechanism as `configure_namespace_gc_timing`, in reverse on success. A failed OpenShift run SHALL skip restore so cleanup can move to teardown instead of waiting on a controller rollout that the environment destroy is about to delete |
| `de_seed_test_users` | Delete the seeded `admin`, `developer`, and `platform-admin` Keycloak accounts at end of run; called unconditionally from the suite's cleanup trap, even on failure; idempotent if the accounts are already gone | No-op: Kind static users MUST NOT be deleted by a test run | No-op on developer-owned OpenShift. On a CI-owned `pr-*` environment, delete those three realm users as `ephemeral-test-credentials.spec.md` defines |

### CI Pipeline

Images are built by Konflux, not by the CI workflow. The e2e workflow gates on Konflux builds completing, then pulls those images by digest into the Kind cluster. This avoids duplicating the build step and ensures the images tested in CI are identical to the images that ship.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Infra Driver Abstraction

The e2e test framework SHALL isolate infrastructure-specific logic into driver scripts located at `tests/e2e/drivers/<driver>.sh`. The main test script (`tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh`) SHALL remain infrastructure-agnostic and call only driver interface functions for infrastructure-specific operations. Only `kind` and `openshift` drivers are supported today; additional drivers are follow-up work.

The script SHALL auto-detect the driver from the current KUBECONFIG context rather than require the caller to select one: it SHALL query the cluster's API groups and select `openshift` when `route.openshift.io` is present, and `kind` otherwise. The `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` environment variable SHALL override auto-detection when set. A user SHALL be able to run the suite with no infra-related environment variables and have it correctly select the driver matching the cluster their KUBECONFIG context points at.

#### Scenario: Kind Driver Auto-Detected

- GIVEN the current KUBECONFIG context points at a cluster that does not serve the `route.openshift.io` API group
- AND `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` is not set
- WHEN the e2e test script starts
- THEN the `tests/e2e/drivers/kind.sh` driver SHALL be sourced
- AND all infrastructure functions SHALL use `kubectl` and Kind-specific discovery (HTTPRoute hostnames, Gateway API status)

#### Scenario: OpenShift Driver Auto-Detected

- GIVEN the current KUBECONFIG context points at a cluster that serves the `route.openshift.io` API group
- AND `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` is not set
- WHEN the e2e test script starts
- THEN the `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh` driver SHALL be sourced
- AND all infrastructure functions SHALL use `oc` and OpenShift-specific discovery as `openshift-development.spec.md` defines (Gateway API status and the configured gateway base domain)

#### Scenario: Driver Override

- GIVEN the current KUBECONFIG context points at a cluster that would auto-detect to a different driver
- AND `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` is set explicitly
- WHEN the e2e test script starts
- THEN the script SHALL source the driver `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` names, bypassing auto-detection

#### Scenario: New Driver Extensibility

- GIVEN a developer creates `tests/e2e/drivers/eks.sh` implementing all interface functions
- WHEN a user runs the e2e tests with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=eks`
- THEN the tests SHALL execute against EKS without modifying the main test script or the auto-detection logic

#### Scenario: Unknown Driver

- GIVEN `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=nonexistent`
- WHEN the e2e test script starts
- THEN the script SHALL exit with a non-zero status
- AND print available drivers by listing `tests/e2e/drivers/*.sh`

### Requirement: Driver Interface Contract

Each driver script SHALL export the following shell functions. The main test script SHALL call only these functions for infrastructure-specific operations. A driver that does not implement all required functions SHALL cause the test script to exit with an error at startup. This spec defines the contract for all drivers and covers the Kind driver implementation. The OpenShift implementation of this contract (the `oc` commands, Route discovery, gateway-base-domain lookup from the shared Gateway listener, and OIDC issuer derivation from the Keycloak Route) is specified in `openshift-development.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-44); the table below is the contract it implements.

`acquire_oidc_token` and `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` SHALL keep those names, signatures, and suite call sites. The token grant they use SHALL be selected by `E2E_OIDC_GRANT`:

- unset or `password` -- resource-owner password grant against the supplied (or default seeded) username and password. This is the Kind path and the default for manual OpenShift runs.
- `client_credentials` -- the GitHub-brokered pull-request path. Admin HyperShell API tokens SHALL use the `hypershell-e2e` client-credentials grant. Admin per-gateway tokens SHALL token-exchange that service account onto the gateway client without impersonating the seeded `admin` user. Developer HyperShell API tokens and per-gateway `openshell-user` tokens SHALL use token-exchange impersonation of the seeded developer principal, as `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` defines.

The pull-request workflow SHALL set `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials`. Kind CI SHALL leave it unset or set `password`.

The suite SHALL call `de_seed_test_users` from the same cleanup trap as `restore_namespace_gc_timing`, on every exit path. Kind SHALL no-op. The OpenShift driver SHALL delete the three test-tier Keycloak accounts only when the run is against a CI-owned PR environment, as `ephemeral-test-credentials.spec.md` defines.

#### Scenario: API Host Discovery -- Kind

- GIVEN the `kind` driver is active
- WHEN `discover_api_host` is called
- THEN it SHALL return `api.hypershell.localhost` (the HTTPRoute hostname from `deploy/kind/httproutes.yaml`)
- OR fall back to `localhost:<port>` via `kubectl port-forward svc/hypershell-api-server` if the HTTPRoute is not reachable

#### Scenario: Gateway Endpoint Discovery -- Kind

- GIVEN the `kind` driver is active
- AND a gateway named `$GW_NAME` exists in namespace `$GW_NAMESPACE`
- WHEN `discover_gateway_endpoint` is called
- THEN it SHALL return `https://<gw-name>.gw.localhost:443` derived from the GRPCRoute hostname and the networking Gateway's status address

#### Scenario: Cluster Domain -- Kind

- GIVEN the `kind` driver is active
- WHEN `get_cluster_domain` is called
- THEN it SHALL return `gw.localhost` (matching the `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` environment variable set on the control plane in the Kind deployment)

#### Scenario: CLI Binary -- Kind

- GIVEN the `kind` driver is active
- WHEN `get_cli_binary` is called
- THEN it SHALL return `kubectl`

#### Scenario: Wait for Gateway Route -- Kind

- GIVEN the `kind` driver is active
- AND a gateway named `$GW_NAME` has been provisioned
- WHEN `wait_for_gateway_route` is called
- THEN it SHALL poll the Gateway API Gateway resource's status conditions for `Programmed=True`
- AND verify the corresponding GRPCRoute's parent status reports `Accepted=True`
- AND return success when both conditions are met or fail after `E2E_PROVISION_TIMEOUT` seconds

#### Scenario: Kind and manual OpenShift use the password grant

- GIVEN `E2E_OIDC_GRANT` is unset or set to `password`
- WHEN the suite calls `acquire_oidc_token` or `acquire_gateway_token_with_role`
- THEN the driver SHALL use a resource-owner password grant against the seeded user
- AND the function name and arguments SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Pull-request OpenShift uses client credentials and token exchange

- GIVEN `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials`
- WHEN the suite calls `acquire_oidc_token` for the admin path
- THEN the driver SHALL use the `hypershell-e2e` client-credentials grant
- AND when the suite calls `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` for the seeded developer principal
- THEN the driver SHALL use token-exchange impersonation targeting that gateway client
- AND when the suite calls `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` for the admin path
- THEN the driver SHALL token-exchange the `hypershell-e2e` service account onto that gateway client without impersonating the seeded `admin` user
- AND neither call SHALL use a password grant

#### Scenario: CI-owned OpenShift de-seeds test users; Kind does not

- GIVEN the suite reaches its cleanup trap
- WHEN it calls `de_seed_test_users`
- THEN the Kind driver SHALL no-op
- AND the OpenShift driver SHALL delete `admin`, `developer`, and `platform-admin` from the realm when the run is against a CI-owned `pr-*` environment
- AND the OpenShift driver SHALL no-op when the run is against a developer-owned environment

The OpenShift driver implements the same interface functions with OpenShift constructs (Route host for `discover_api_host`, GRPCRoute hostname via the shared Gateway with `Programmed=True` for `discover_gateway_endpoint`, the gateway base domain `make openshift-up` derived from the shared Gateway listener hostname for `get_cluster_domain`, `oc` for `get_cli_binary`, Gateway `Programmed=True` plus GRPCRoute parent `Accepted=True` for `wait_for_gateway_route`, the HyperShell Keycloak reached at its Route in the `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` namespace for `acquire_oidc_token` and `api_curl`, that same Keycloak's admin API for the `assign_gateway_client_role`, `assign_realm_role`, and `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` role helpers, and `de_seed_test_users` against that realm on CI-owned `pr-*` environments only), as the interface table above shows. `openshift-development.spec.md` owns bring-up (`make openshift-up`, the overlay, cluster bootstrap); this spec owns the driver the suite calls after that environment exists. Automated OpenShift pull-request CI is specified in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-240). Test-tier seed and de-seed behavior is specified in `ephemeral-test-credentials.spec.md`.

### Requirement: Custom OpenShift Runs

Each target SHALL auto-detect the driver from the current KUBECONFIG context (see [Infra Driver Abstraction](#requirement-infra-driver-abstraction)) and SHALL honor an `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` command-line override. A user SHALL be able to run `make e2e` and `make e2e-performance` **manually** against any OpenShift cluster, so scale and performance testing can target a real OpenShift environment: a user logged in to an OpenShift cluster via `oc login` SHALL run `make e2e` or `make e2e-performance` and have the suite auto-detect the OpenShift driver, or force it explicitly with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e` / `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e-performance`. These OpenShift runs SHALL NOT create a cluster and SHALL NOT create a namespace beyond the gateways the suite provisions; the environment is a precondition.

**Preconditions (owned by `openshift-development.spec.md`).** These runs assume HyperShell is already deployed on the cluster through `make openshift-up` (`kustomize build deploy/openshift/` mapped into the current `oc` project, or `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE`). That bring-up creates the companion `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` project, applies Routes for the API, web console, and Keycloak, applies `keycloak-allow-platform` so platform pods can reach JWKS, applies per-environment ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings named `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-dev-*`, and applies the privileged SCC RoleBinding `hypershell-sandbox-scc`. The cluster infrastructure bootstrap (shared Gateway, GatewayClass, certificate issuer, wildcard certificate) is in place per `openshift-development.spec.md`. The suite SHALL fail with a clear error, not a broken run, when the API Route or the gateway infrastructure is absent.

**Driver behavior needed for parity.** For the shared suite to pass on OpenShift, the OpenShift driver SHALL use the current `oc` project when `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` is unset (and fail clearly when neither is available), matching `make openshift-up`; derive the OIDC issuer from the Keycloak Route in `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` (not the Kind default `keycloak.hypershell.localhost`); return `get_cluster_domain` from the same shared-Gateway listener hostname `make openshift-up` used; and provide the same Keycloak admin and role-assignment helpers the Kind driver provides, so the RBAC areas (developer and platform-admin) run unchanged. The OpenShift deployment SHALL enforce RBAC (`RBAC_ENFORCE=true`) and SHALL keep the OpenShift SCC posture (per-namespace privileged SCC for sandbox pods), so the sandbox and RBAC areas behave the same as on Kind. These behaviors are specified in `openshift-development.spec.md`; this spec only depends on them.

**Namespace GC timing.** Area 11 exercises the periodic namespace reaper. Every deploy target (Kind included) runs with the production `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_INTERVAL`/`GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_GRACE_PERIOD` defaults (5m sweep / 10m grace) -- no overlay bakes in shortened e2e timing, so Kind stays representative of a vanilla deployment. Instead, a long-mode run SHALL call `configure_namespace_gc_timing` once, before any gateway is created, to patch the controller deployment to a short interval/grace period for the duration of the run, and SHALL call `restore_namespace_gc_timing` from the suite's cleanup path so the deployment's production defaults are restored. Kind SHALL restore on every exit, including failure. A failed OpenShift run SHALL skip restore and proceed to teardown: the environment is destroyed next, so a controller rollout wait has no effect. That same cleanup path SHALL call `de_seed_test_users` as the driver table defines.

**Not in this spec's CI.** OpenShift performance runs SHALL NOT be wired into CI. Kind e2e, including the merge-queue gate, SHALL remain the CI job this spec defines. Origin-repository OpenShift pull-request environments are specified in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` and SHALL NOT be restated here.

#### Scenario: e2e Against OpenShift

- GIVEN the OpenShift driver is present at `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh`
- AND a user is logged in to an OpenShift cluster with HyperShell deployed via `make openshift-up`
- AND the cluster infrastructure bootstrap is in place per `openshift-development.spec.md`
- WHEN the user runs `make e2e` with no `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` set, or runs `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e` explicitly
- THEN the suite SHALL run against that cluster using the OpenShift driver
- AND no Kind cluster SHALL be created

#### Scenario: Performance Against OpenShift

- GIVEN the OpenShift driver is present at `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh`
- AND a user is logged in to an OpenShift cluster with HyperShell deployed via `make openshift-up`
- WHEN the user runs `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e-performance`
- THEN the performance harness SHALL run against that cluster using the OpenShift driver
- AND it SHALL provision the perf fleet on that cluster and report metrics

#### Scenario: Missing Environment Fails Fast

- GIVEN an OpenShift cluster where the HyperShell API Route or gateway infrastructure is absent
- WHEN the user runs `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e`
- THEN the suite SHALL fail with a clear error about the missing environment
- AND it SHALL NOT report false passes

#### Scenario: Kind remains this spec's CI job

- GIVEN the CI configuration this spec owns
- WHEN a pull request runs the Kind e2e workflow
- THEN it SHALL run the Kind e2e job as this spec defines
- AND it SHALL NOT run the performance test against OpenShift
- AND OpenShift pull-request environments SHALL be the job
  `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` defines, not a second copy of this spec

#### Scenario: Merge-queue stays on Kind

- GIVEN a pull request enters the GitHub merge queue
- WHEN CI evaluates which e2e jobs to run
- THEN the Kind e2e job SHALL be the merge-queue e2e job this spec defines, including the e2e-relevant skip
- AND the OpenShift pull-request environment workflow SHALL NOT run

### Requirement: E2E Test Suite Coverage

The e2e test suite SHALL validate the following 11 areas, matching the 11 numbered sections of the live `tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` and extending the original test structure from `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`. All test areas SHALL be infrastructure-agnostic -- they call driver functions for infra-specific operations and use the Kubernetes API for resource inspection.

1. **OIDC authentication** -- acquire an admin OIDC access token via `acquire_oidc_token`, the credential every subsequent API call carries through `api_curl` (see OIDC Authentication in E2E Tests)
2. **Gateway provisioning via HyperShell API** -- create a gateway via the REST API and wait for the control plane to reconcile it to `Running` phase
3. **Gateway infrastructure verification** -- confirm the gateway deployment, service, TLS secret, certgen job, and NetworkPolicy exist and are healthy
4. **Gateway token + CA trust** -- fetch the gateway connection token and CA bundle so the CLI connects over trusted TLS, with no insecure bypass (see Gateway TLS Trust)
5. **Route discovery + openshell CLI registration** -- discover the gateway endpoint via the driver, register it with the openshell CLI
6. **Gateway connectivity** -- verify the openshell CLI can connect to the gateway and report status over the trusted TLS established in area 4
7. **Sandbox lifecycle** -- create a sandbox as the admin user, wait for the pod to reach `Running` state, and verify the gateway's `active_sandbox_count` accounting reflects sandbox create and delete (see Active Sandbox Count Accounting)
8. **Sandbox interaction** -- execute commands inside the sandbox (`uname -a`, `ls /workspace`)
9. **Developer user RBAC verification** -- authenticate as the `developer` user (the `openshell-user` tier) and confirm it MAY create a sandbox but MAY NOT create a gateway via the HyperShell API (see Developer RBAC Enforcement)
10. **Platform-admin RBAC verification** -- authenticate as a platform-admin user and confirm the elevated permissions the developer tier is denied, including deleting a gateway through the HyperShell API (see Developer RBAC Enforcement)
11. **Gateway deletion + namespace garbage collection** -- validate both garbage-collection paths from `openshell-gateway-namespace-gc.spec.md`: (a) seed a synthetic orphaned managed namespace after gateway provisioning and validate periodic `NamespaceGCReconciler` reap + `GarbageCollected` Event (while the earlier areas run in parallel with the reaper); (b) delete-driven reap of the gateway's managed namespace (see Gateway Deletion and Namespace GC)

The admin OIDC token from area 1 authenticates the API calls in areas 2--8 and 11; the developer and platform-admin areas (9 and 10) each acquire their own token via `acquire_oidc_token` for their user (see OIDC Authentication in E2E Tests).

#### Scenario: Full Suite Execution

- GIVEN a running HyperShell environment (Kind or OpenShift)
- WHEN the e2e test suite runs
- THEN all 11 test areas SHALL be executed in sequence
- AND results SHALL be reported as pass/fail counts with per-test detail

#### Scenario: Gateway Provisioning

- GIVEN the HyperShell API is reachable (via `discover_api_host`)
- WHEN a gateway is created via `POST /api/hypershell/v1/gateways`
- THEN the test SHALL poll the API until the gateway phase is `Running` or `E2E_PROVISION_TIMEOUT` seconds have elapsed
- AND a timeout SHALL be reported as a test failure

#### Scenario: Seeded Cluster and Release Discovery

- GIVEN the HyperShell API is reachable and the suite has an admin bearer token
- WHEN area 2 looks up the seeded managed cluster and gateway release
- THEN it SHALL query `GET /managed_clusters` and `GET /gateway_releases` through `api_curl` and select by `E2E_SEED_CLUSTER_NAME` / `E2E_SEED_RELEASE_NAME`
- AND on `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=kind` those names SHALL default to `local-kind` / `dev-release`
- AND on `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift` those names SHALL default to `local-openshift` / `dev-release`
- AND when either id is missing, the suite SHALL fail the area and print whether each list body was empty, an API `Error` (code and reason), or unparseable, plus a re-seed hint (`SEED_STRICT=true make openshift-seed` or `make kind-seed`)

#### Scenario: Infrastructure Verification

- GIVEN a gateway has reached `Running` phase
- WHEN the test verifies infrastructure
- THEN it SHALL confirm: deployment `openshell-gateway` exists and has at least 1 ready replica, service `openshell-gateway` exists with a ClusterIP, TLS secret `openshell-server-tls` exists, certgen job `openshell-gateway-certgen` has succeeded

#### Scenario: Sandbox Lifecycle

- GIVEN the openshell CLI is connected to the gateway
- WHEN `sandbox create --name <name>` is invoked
- THEN a pod matching `default--<name>` SHALL appear in the gateway namespace
- AND the pod SHALL reach `Running` state within `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` seconds

### Requirement: Active Sandbox Count Accounting

The e2e test suite SHALL validate that a gateway's read-only `active_sandbox_count`
field, reported by the HyperShell API, tracks sandbox creation and deletion. The
suite SHALL create two to three sandboxes on a `Running` gateway, poll the API
until `active_sandbox_count` reflects the created sandboxes, then delete one or
more and poll until the count decrements accordingly. The suite SHALL reuse the
existing sandbox create/delete steps and the API-polling helper. Because the
count is an advisory recent value that may lag real time (see
`openshell-gateway-sandbox-count.spec.md`), assertions SHALL poll up to
`E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` seconds for the expected value rather than checking once.

#### Scenario: Count increments as sandboxes are created

- GIVEN a `Running` gateway with `active_sandbox_count` of 0
- WHEN two to three sandboxes are created on that gateway and their pods reach
  `Running` state
- THEN polling `GET /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/<id>` SHALL report an
  `active_sandbox_count` equal to the number of sandboxes created, within
  `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` seconds
- AND a timeout without the expected count SHALL be reported as a test failure

#### Scenario: Count decrements as sandboxes are deleted

- GIVEN a `Running` gateway whose `active_sandbox_count` reflects the created
  sandboxes
- WHEN one or more of those sandboxes are deleted and their pods terminate
- THEN polling the API SHALL report an `active_sandbox_count` reduced by the
  number of sandboxes deleted, within `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` seconds
- AND the suite SHALL delete any remaining sandboxes to leave a clean state

### Requirement: Developer RBAC Enforcement

The e2e test suite SHALL verify the RBAC boundary of the `openshell-user` tier by exercising both an operation it is allowed to perform and one it is not. The `developer` user (credentials `E2E_DEV_USERNAME` / `E2E_DEV_PASSWORD`) maps to `gateway:viewer` -> `openshell-user` per `specs/security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md`. This tier is a legitimate *user* of a gateway it can reach: it MAY create sandboxes on that gateway (the `openshell-user` role is authorized for sandbox create/list/exec per `specs/platform/openshell-gateway-oidc.spec.md`), but it is NOT a `gateway:creator` in Keycloak. Whether `POST /gateways` is allowed SHALL follow the API server's `RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLES`: empty (OpenShift/production) MUST return `403 Forbidden`; unset Kind default `gateway:creator` MUST return 2xx. The suite SHALL read that env from the `hypershell-api-server` Deployment rather than branching on `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER`. The sandbox half SHALL succeed in both postures.

#### Scenario: Openshell User May Create a Sandbox

- GIVEN a valid OIDC token has been acquired for the `developer` user
- AND the openshell CLI is registered against the gateway with that token
- WHEN `sandbox create` is invoked
- THEN a sandbox pod matching `default--<name>` SHALL be created within `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` seconds
- AND the test SHALL record a pass and delete the sandbox to leave a clean state

#### Scenario: Openshell User May Not Create a Gateway

- GIVEN a valid OIDC token has been acquired for the `developer` user
- AND the API server's `RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLES` does not include `gateway:creator` (OpenShift sets the env to empty; production isolation)
- WHEN the developer calls `POST /api/hypershell/v1/gateways` with that token
- THEN the API SHALL return `403 Forbidden` (the developer lacks the platform-scoped `gateway:creator` role)
- AND the test SHALL record a pass for the denial

#### Scenario: Openshell User May List Gateways

- GIVEN a valid OIDC token has been acquired for the `developer` user
- AND the API server's `RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLES` does not include `gateway:creator`
- AND the developer has no per-gateway RoleBinding
- WHEN the developer calls `GET /api/hypershell/v1/gateways`
- THEN the API SHALL return 200 with a `GatewayList` body
- AND the console SHALL NOT show "Gateways could not be loaded"

#### Scenario: Default Creator Binding Allows Gateway Create

- GIVEN a valid OIDC token has been acquired for the `developer` user
- AND `RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLES` is unset on the API server (Kind; the process default is `gateway:creator`)
- WHEN the developer calls `POST /api/hypershell/v1/gateways` with that token
- THEN the API SHALL return 2xx (HYPERSHELL-262 default-role bootstrap)
- AND the test SHALL delete the created gateway

#### Scenario: Unexpected Success Is a Failure

- GIVEN the `developer` user attempts to create a gateway
- AND `RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLES` does not include `gateway:creator`
- WHEN the API returns a 2xx status despite the missing `gateway:creator` role
- THEN the test SHALL record a failure (RBAC not enforced)
- AND the test SHALL delete the erroneously-created gateway to leave a clean state

### Requirement: Gateway Deletion and Namespace GC

The e2e test suite SHALL validate both garbage-collection paths described in
`openshell-gateway-namespace-gc.spec.md`:

1. **Periodic reaper** -- the `NamespaceGCReconciler` sweeps managed namespaces
   with no live Gateway, respects the grace period, records a `GarbageCollected`
   Kubernetes Event in the control-plane namespace via `recordGCEvent`, then
   deletes the namespace.
2. **Delete-driven reap** -- deleting a Gateway through the HyperShell API drives
   the control plane to remove the gateway record and reap its managed namespace
   (`DeleteManagedNamespace`; this path does not emit the periodic GC Event).

#### Periodic orphan namespace GC

To exercise the periodic path without waiting for production defaults (5m sweep /
10m grace), a long-mode run SHALL call `configure_namespace_gc_timing` once,
before any gateway is created, which patches the control-plane deployment with
`GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_INTERVAL` and `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_GRACE_PERIOD` set to
short Go duration strings (for example `30s`; any positive value accepted by
`time.ParseDuration` is valid). The suite SHALL call `restore_namespace_gc_timing`
from its cleanup path so the deployment's production defaults are restored.
Kind SHALL restore on every exit, including failure. A failed OpenShift run
SHALL skip restore so cleanup can move to teardown rather than wait on a
controller rollout the environment destroy is about to delete. No deploy overlay
SHALL bake in shortened e2e timing.

Immediately after gateway provisioning succeeds,
the suite SHALL seed a synthetic orphaned managed namespace (`openshell-e2e-orphan-*`)
labeled with the three required ownership labels (`hypershell.redhat.io/managed=true`,
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=hypershell-control-plane`, and
`hypershell.redhat.io/instance=<E2E_HS_NAMESPACE>`) and a name matching
the gateway prefix, annotate it with a
backdated `hypershell.redhat.io/gc-eligible-since` timestamp so the next sweep can
reap without waiting a full grace period. Steps 3–10 SHALL run while the periodic
reaper may delete that namespace in the background, so the suite is not blocked
waiting on the sweep interval. In step 11 the suite SHALL validate delete-driven
gateway namespace GC first, then assert the orphan namespace was reaped and a
`GarbageCollected` Event exists in the control-plane namespace
(`E2E_HS_NAMESPACE`, default `hypershell-system`) with `involvedObject.name`
equal to the orphan namespace name. The orphan reap deadline SHALL be measured
from seed time (`E2E_ORPHAN_GC_TIMEOUT` seconds after creation); if the namespace
is already gone when step 11 runs, validation SHALL pass without additional
waiting. Failure to reap or to record the Event SHALL be reported with GC
diagnostics (namespace state and control-plane logs).

#### Delete-driven gateway namespace GC

Before deletion the suite SHALL confirm the gateway's managed namespace exists,
so its later disappearance is a real garbage-collection signal rather than a
namespace that never existed. After issuing
`DELETE /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/<id>`, the suite SHALL poll until the gateway
record returns `404` (the delete event has been processed) and until the managed
namespace is gone, within `E2E_GC_TIMEOUT` seconds. A namespace that is not reaped
within the timeout SHALL be reported as a test failure with GC diagnostics (the
namespace's remaining state and control-plane logs).

Deletion SHALL NOT be gated on the gateway's active sandbox count: even with
active sandboxes the delete is accepted and the namespace is reaped, cascading
removal of the in-namespace sandbox resources (see
`openshell-gateway-namespace-gc.spec.md` and `openshell-gateway-database.spec.md`).

#### Scenario: Periodic orphan namespace garbage collected

- GIVEN the suite has called `configure_namespace_gc_timing`, which shortened
  `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_INTERVAL` and `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_GRACE_PERIOD`
  (for example `30s`)
- AND a synthetic managed namespace was seeded after gateway provisioning with
  this instance's three ownership labels, a gateway-style name, and a backdated
  `hypershell.redhat.io/gc-eligible-since`
  annotation, with no live Gateway backing it
- AND steps 3–10 have run while the periodic reaper may have deleted it
- WHEN the suite validates orphan GC in step 11 (after delete-driven GC)
- THEN the namespace SHALL be gone within `E2E_ORPHAN_GC_TIMEOUT` seconds of
  seeding
- AND a namespace still present after that deadline SHALL be reported as a
  failure with GC diagnostics

#### Scenario: GarbageCollected Event recorded for periodic reap

- GIVEN the periodic reaper has deleted the synthetic orphan namespace
- WHEN the suite queries Events in the control-plane namespace
- THEN a `GarbageCollected` Event SHALL exist with `involvedObject.name` equal to
  the orphan namespace name
- AND the absence of such an Event SHALL be reported as a test failure

#### Scenario: Namespace present before deletion

- GIVEN a `Running` gateway whose managed namespace exists
- WHEN the suite checks for the namespace before deleting the gateway
- THEN the namespace SHALL be present
- AND its absence SHALL be reported as a failure, because the GC check cannot then be validated

#### Scenario: Gateway record removed after delete

- GIVEN the gateway has been deleted via `DELETE /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/<id>` (accepted with `204 No Content`)
- WHEN the suite polls `GET /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/<id>`
- THEN the API SHALL report `404` once the control plane has processed the delete event

#### Scenario: Managed namespace garbage collected

- GIVEN the gateway delete has been accepted
- WHEN the suite polls for the gateway's managed namespace
- THEN the namespace SHALL be gone within `E2E_GC_TIMEOUT` seconds
- AND a namespace still present after the timeout SHALL be reported as a failure with GC diagnostics (namespace state and control-plane logs)

### Requirement: Gateway TLS Trust (No Insecure Bypass)

The e2e test suite SHALL connect to the gateway over trusted TLS and SHALL NOT disable certificate verification. The `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_INSECURE=true` bypass SHALL NOT be used. Instead, the suite SHALL trust the cluster's self-signed CA: it extracts the CA certificate issued by cert-manager (the same CA that signs the gateway's serving certificate and the `*.gw.localhost` wildcard listener cert) and points the openshell CLI at it via `SSL_CERT_FILE`. This ensures the e2e path exercises the same TLS trust chain a real client uses, rather than skipping validation.

#### Scenario: CLI Trusts the Cluster CA

- GIVEN the cluster CA certificate has been extracted from the cert-manager-issued secret
- AND `SSL_CERT_FILE` points the openshell CLI at that CA
- WHEN the CLI connects to the gateway gRPC endpoint over TLS
- THEN the connection SHALL succeed with certificate verification enabled
- AND `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_INSECURE` SHALL NOT be set

#### Scenario: Insecure Bypass Removed

- GIVEN the e2e test scripts (`tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh`, `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`)
- WHEN they establish a gateway connection
- THEN they SHALL NOT set `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_INSECURE=true`

### Requirement: CI Checks Workflow

The system SHALL provide an independently-triggered GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/checks.yml` (its own `pull_request`, `push` to `main`, `merge_group`, and `workflow_dispatch` triggers and concurrency group) that runs static and whole-repo checks: per-component lint jobs, repository policy (`make check`), and OpenAPI SDK drift detection. It SHALL be a top-level workflow rather than a stage called from `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, so it appears as its own entry in the PR checks list and runs fully concurrently with `tests.yml`. Because GitHub Actions `needs:` only orders jobs within one workflow file, `checks.yml` SHALL NOT be gated by, and SHALL NOT gate, any job in `tests.yml`; there SHALL be no cross-workflow polling job connecting the two.

`checks.yml` SHALL run its own `detect-changes` job (invoking `.github/scripts/detect-components.sh`) rather than sharing the one in `tests.yml`, since the two workflows cannot pass job outputs to each other. Each lint job SHALL declare `needs: detect-changes` and gate on `needs.detect-changes.outputs.<component> == 'true'`. Repository policy and SDK drift SHALL be jobs in this workflow rather than independently-triggered workflows, so they share this single `detect-changes` pass instead of each re-detecting changes on their own trigger. Repository policy SHALL run unconditionally (it is a whole-repo check, not tied to a single component); the SDK drift job SHALL gate on `needs.detect-changes.outputs.sdk_go == 'true' || needs.detect-changes.outputs.sdk_typescript == 'true'`.

`checks.yml` SHALL provide a `checks-gate` job (`Checks CI Gate`) that runs with `if: always()`, reads every other job's rolled-up `result` via `needs`, and fails unless `detect-changes` succeeded and no other job failed or was cancelled (a job skipped by path filtering SHALL pass the gate). Because it always runs, it is never left pending by path-filtered skips, so this is one of the two checks to mark required in branch protection (the other being `tests.yml`'s own `Tests CI Gate`). The two gate jobs SHALL be named distinctly (`Checks CI Gate` / `Tests CI Gate`) rather than both plain `CI Gate`, since this repo's branch protection is a ruleset whose `required_status_checks` match by `(context name, integration_id)` only, not by workflow file; both workflows' checks share the same "GitHub Actions" integration_id, so identically-named gates would be indistinguishable to the ruleset.

#### Scenario: Checks And Tests Run Concurrently

- GIVEN a pull request is opened or updated
- WHEN `checks.yml` and `tests.yml` both trigger on the same event
- THEN each SHALL run its own `detect-changes` job and proceed independently
- AND a failure in `checks.yml` SHALL NOT prevent any job in `tests.yml` from running, nor vice versa

#### Scenario: Repository Policy And SDK Drift Run As Checks Jobs

- GIVEN a pull request is opened or updated
- WHEN `checks.yml` runs
- THEN the `repository-policy` job SHALL run `make check` unconditionally, regardless of which components changed
- AND the `sdk-drift` job SHALL run only when `needs.detect-changes.outputs.sdk_go` or `needs.detect-changes.outputs.sdk_typescript` is `'true'`
- AND neither job SHALL run change detection of its own

#### Scenario: Checks Gate For Branch Protection

- GIVEN branch protection requires `checks.yml`'s `Checks CI Gate`
- WHEN a pull request runs `checks.yml`
- THEN the `checks-gate` job SHALL run with `if: always()` so it is present even when every lint job is skipped by path filtering
- AND the gate SHALL pass when `detect-changes` succeeded and every other job's result is `success` or `skipped`
- AND the gate SHALL fail when `detect-changes` did not succeed or any other job's result is `failure` or `cancelled`

### Requirement: CI Unit Test Workflow

The unit-test and e2e stages SHALL be ordered by a single orchestrator workflow at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` rather than by cross-workflow status-check polling. `tests.yml` SHALL own the `pull_request`, `push` (to `main`), `merge_group`, and `workflow_dispatch` triggers, the concurrency group, and SHALL call `unit-tests.yml` and `e2e.yml` as reusable workflows (`on: workflow_call`) wired with native `needs:` edges. `unit` SHALL depend only on `detect-changes`, and `e2e` SHALL declare `needs: [detect-changes, unit]` so it starts only after the unit-test stage concludes successfully. Because GitHub Actions skips a job by default if any needed job failed OR was skipped, `e2e` SHALL also declare `if: ${{ !cancelled() && needs.detect-changes.result == 'success' && needs.unit.result != 'failure' }}`, so a PR touching only e2e-owned paths (every job inside `unit` path-filtered away, making the `unit` caller job itself resolve to `skipped`) still runs `e2e` instead of silently skipping it. This gates only the expensive stage: the Kind-based e2e run SHALL NOT start for a SHA whose unit tests failed, and such a failure SHALL surface as a clean red `Tests CI Gate` check rather than a misleading e2e environment failure. There SHALL be no in-workflow job that polls for a preceding Tests or Checks stage's status check, and there SHALL be no cross-workflow poller for Deploy OpenShift Environment: that job SHALL live in `e2e.yml` so OpenShift can `needs:` it. The stage workflows SHALL NOT declare their own event triggers (only `workflow_call`) so they never run as standalone duplicates. `tests.yml` SHALL NOT be gated by, and SHALL NOT gate, the separate `checks.yml` workflow (see the CI Checks Workflow requirement); the two run fully concurrently.

Change detection SHALL run exactly once per workflow, in a `detect-changes` job in `tests.yml` (invoking `.github/scripts/detect-components.sh`), whose per-component outputs are passed into each stage as `with:` inputs; the stage workflows SHALL NOT detect changes internally and SHALL gate their jobs on `inputs.<component>`. Because each stage is a reusable-workflow call, its individual jobs surface as `Unit / <job>` and `E2E / <job>` checks rather than a single per-stage check. `tests.yml` SHALL therefore provide a `tests-gate` job (`Tests CI Gate`) covering the `unit` and `e2e` stages together, which SHALL run with `if: always()`, read both stages' rolled-up `result` via `needs`, and fail unless `detect-changes` succeeded and neither stage failed or cancelled (a fully skipped stage SHALL pass the gate). Because it always runs, it is never left pending by path-filtered skips, so this is one of the two checks to mark required in branch protection (the other being `checks.yml`'s own `Checks CI Gate`).

The system SHALL provide a reusable GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml` (`on: workflow_call`) that runs unit tests as a cheap gate on the E2E stage. It SHALL receive the changed-component flags as `workflow_call` inputs and gate conditional jobs on those inputs rather than detecting changes itself; the `Tests CI Gate` job in `tests.yml` rolls its result (together with e2e's) up into the required check, so it has no summary or gate job of its own. Frontend, Go, and shell unit tests SHALL run in separate jobs and SHALL run only when their inputs changed. Shell unit tests SHALL be auto-discovered (`*_test.sh`) rather than listed in the workflow or Makefile. The Kind e2e stage SHALL NOT start until the unit-test stage succeeds.

The root Makefile SHALL provide a `make unit-test-all` target that runs the same unit test suites as the CI jobs (API server, control plane, CLI/SDK generators, frontend packages, and shell tests) unconditionally -- without the per-component change detection the CI workflow uses -- so a developer can run the full suite locally before pushing. It SHALL provide a `make ci-test` target that runs only the auto-discovered `*_test.sh` shell tests, matching the CI shell-test job.

#### Scenario: Local Unit Test Run Mirrors CI

- GIVEN a developer has made changes across multiple components
- WHEN they run `make unit-test-all`
- THEN the API server, control plane, CLI/SDK generator, frontend, and shell unit test suites SHALL all run
- AND a failure in any suite SHALL fail the `make unit-test-all` command

#### Scenario: Path-Filtered Unit Test Jobs

- GIVEN a pull request changes only files for one unit-test group (frontend, a Go module, or shell tests)
- WHEN the unit-test stage evaluates its per-component inputs
- THEN only the matching unit-test job SHALL run
- AND skipped jobs SHALL NOT fail the `Tests CI Gate` check

#### Scenario: Tests Gate For Branch Protection

- GIVEN branch protection requires `tests.yml`'s `Tests CI Gate`
- WHEN a pull request runs `tests.yml`
- THEN the `tests-gate` job SHALL run with `if: always()` so it is present even when the unit and e2e stages' jobs are all skipped by path filtering
- AND the gate SHALL pass when `detect-changes` succeeded and both stages' results are `success` or `skipped`
- AND the gate SHALL fail when `detect-changes` did not succeed or either stage's result is `failure` or `cancelled`

#### Scenario: Shell Unit Tests Auto-Discovered

- GIVEN a new `*_test.sh` file is added next to the script it tests
- WHEN `make ci-test` or the shell unit-test job runs
- THEN that file SHALL be discovered and executed without updating a Makefile allowlist or workflow job list

#### Scenario: E2E Runs After Unit Tests

- GIVEN a pull request is opened or updated
- WHEN the `tests.yml` orchestrator runs
- THEN the `e2e` stage SHALL declare `needs: [detect-changes, unit]` so no e2e job (including image planning, Kind creation, and Deploy OpenShift Environment) starts until the `unit` stage concludes successfully
- AND a failing `unit` stage SHALL leave the entire e2e stage un-started (skipped), so Kind is never created and no per-PR OpenShift environment is deployed for a SHA with failing unit tests
- AND a failure in the separate `checks.yml` workflow SHALL NOT prevent the `e2e` stage from starting

#### Scenario: E2E Still Runs When Unit Is Entirely Path-Filtered Out

- GIVEN a pull request changes only e2e-owned paths and no unit-tested component
- WHEN the `tests.yml` orchestrator runs
- THEN every job inside the `unit` stage SHALL be skipped by its own `inputs.<component>` condition, and the `unit` caller job's own result SHALL resolve to `skipped`
- AND the `e2e` stage's `if: ${{ !cancelled() && needs.detect-changes.result == 'success' && needs.unit.result != 'failure' }}` SHALL still evaluate true, so `e2e` runs rather than being skipped by GitHub Actions' default needs-propagation behavior

### Requirement: CI E2E Workflow

The system SHALL provide a reusable GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` (`on: workflow_call`) that runs the e2e test suite against Kind and, on origin pull requests and on push to `main`, against an OpenShift environment. It SHALL run as the final stage of `tests.yml`, which triggers on every pull request, on every merge-queue entry (`merge_group`), and on push to `main`. On `merge_group`, Kind SHALL honor the same `should_run` e2e-relevant path gate as `pull_request`, evaluated against the merge batch's three-dot diff from `merge_group.base_sha`, so a docs-only merge-queue entry skips Kind while a batch that includes e2e-relevant paths still gates. Like the unit stage, it SHALL receive the changed-component flags as `workflow_call` inputs and gate its jobs on those inputs rather than detecting changes itself; the `Tests CI Gate` job in `tests.yml` rolls its result (together with unit's) up into the required check, so it has no summary or gate job of its own. The orchestrator's `needs: [detect-changes, unit]` edge (with the `if:` override described in the CI Unit Test Workflow requirement, so a `unit` skip does not also skip `e2e`) SHALL ensure Kind is never created until the unit-test stage succeeds; the e2e workflow itself SHALL NOT contain a job that polls for that gate, or for the separate `checks.yml` workflow. The workflow SHALL still gate Kind jobs on Konflux image builds completing (an external build system it cannot order with `needs:`) and pull those images by digest -- it SHALL NOT rebuild component images itself.

`e2e.yml` SHALL run a job named `Deploy OpenShift Environment` (check: Tests / E2E / Deploy OpenShift Environment) and a job named `OpenShift` (check: Tests / E2E / OpenShift) on origin `pull_request` events and on push to `main`. Both SHALL run only when `plan-images` sets `should_run=true`, matching Kind, so an e2e-irrelevant origin PR skips deploy and the OpenShift suite as well as Kind. OpenShift SHALL declare `needs: [plan-images, deploy]` and SHALL start only after that deploy job succeeds. After the suite, including on failure or cancel, OpenShift SHALL destroy the unretained environment as `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` defines; a teardown failure SHALL fail the OpenShift check. The only skip for that teardown is a retained pull request (`pr-environment/pr-extended`). Origin pull requests SHALL deploy `hypershell-ci-pr-<n>` with GitHub-brokered OAuth and the access comment. Push to `main` SHALL deploy `hypershell-ci-main-<short-sha>` (first 7 characters of the commit SHA) without OAuth or a pull-request comment; `main` has no retainment label, so teardown always runs. The per-commit namespace SHALL keep a cancelled older push's `openshift-down` from deleting a newer deploy: concurrency remains `pr-env-main` with `cancel-in-progress` so rapid pushes still serialize on the shared cluster. There SHALL NOT be a separate OpenShift-on-main workflow: the same two Tests / E2E jobs cover both events, so pull requests do not list a skipped dedicated main check. Fork PRs and `merge_group` SHALL skip those jobs (no per-PR environment; Kind remains the merge-queue gate).

#### Scenario: PR Triggers Workflow

- GIVEN a pull request is opened or updated
- AND the unit-test stage has succeeded (satisfying the orchestrator's `needs: [detect-changes, unit]` edge)
- AND Konflux has built images for changed components
- WHEN the `e2e` stage runs
- THEN it SHALL: check out the repository, use the changed-component flags passed in as inputs, create a Kind cluster via `make kind-up` with baseline images (overlapping cluster creation with the Konflux builds in progress), wait for each changed component's Konflux on-pull-request build to conclude, swap in the Konflux-built image digests via `scripts/kind/set-component-images.sh`, run `tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=kind`, and report the CI status

#### Scenario: OpenShift E2E Needs Deploy OpenShift Environment

- GIVEN an origin pull request whose e2e-relevant components changed
- AND whose `Deploy OpenShift Environment` job is still running
- WHEN Tests / E2E / OpenShift is evaluated
- THEN it SHALL have required `plan-images` with `should_run=true`, matching Kind
- AND it SHALL `needs:` that deploy job rather than polling a check
- AND it SHALL then run `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials bash tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` against the per-PR namespace
- AND after the suite, including on failure or cancel, it SHALL destroy the environment unless the pull request is marked retained
- AND a fork PR, `merge_group` event, or origin PR with `should_run=false` SHALL skip this job
- AND a failing `unit` stage SHALL skip deploy and this job

#### Scenario: Push to main uses the same OpenShift jobs

- GIVEN a push to `main` whose unit stage has succeeded
- AND whose `plan-images` job sets `should_run=true`
- AND the commit SHA is `abcdef1234567890`
- WHEN Deploy OpenShift Environment and Tests / E2E / OpenShift run
- THEN they SHALL use `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE=hypershell-ci-main-abcdef1`
- AND they SHALL NOT post or update a pull-request access comment
- AND they SHALL NOT provision GitHub OAuth (admin/admin password grant)
- AND after the suite, including on failure or cancel, they SHALL destroy that namespace
- AND a `merge_group` event SHALL still skip these jobs

#### Scenario: Cancelled older main push does not delete a newer deploy

- GIVEN push A is deploying `hypershell-ci-main-<sha-a>`
- WHEN push B starts and cancels push A's OpenShift jobs
- THEN push A's teardown SHALL destroy `hypershell-ci-main-<sha-a>`
- AND push B SHALL deploy `hypershell-ci-main-<sha-b>`
- AND push A's teardown SHALL NOT delete push B's namespace

#### Scenario: Tests Pass

- GIVEN the e2e tests complete with 0 failures
- WHEN the workflow finishes
- THEN the CI status check SHALL be reported as `success`

#### Scenario: Tests Fail

- GIVEN one or more e2e tests fail
- WHEN the workflow finishes
- THEN the CI status check SHALL be reported as `failure`
- AND diagnostic artifacts SHALL be uploaded (see CI Artifact Collection)

#### Scenario: Skip for Irrelevant Changes

- GIVEN the PR modifies only files outside the e2e-relevant component paths (e.g., only `docs/` or `components/sdk-typescript/`)
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow evaluates the change detection outputs
- THEN `plan-images` SHALL set `should_run=false`
- AND both the Kind and OpenShift e2e jobs SHALL be skipped
- AND the `Deploy OpenShift Environment` job SHALL be skipped
- AND the workflow SHALL report `success` (to avoid blocking merges)

#### Scenario: Infrastructure-Only Changes (No Source Components)

- GIVEN the PR modifies e2e-relevant files (Makefile, `.github/`, `deploy/`, `tests/e2e/`) but no files under `components/api-server/`, `components/control-plane/`, `components/web-console/`, or `packages/gateway-management-ui/`
- AND the PR does not change any component's Konflux pipeline definition (`.tekton/hypershell-<component>-main-pull-request.yaml`) or the root `Dockerfile`
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow evaluates the change detection outputs
- THEN the e2e job SHALL run using baseline registry images (no Konflux build wait)
- AND the workflow SHALL NOT poll for Konflux check runs

#### Scenario: Component Pipeline Definition Changed

- GIVEN the PR changes a component's Konflux pull-request pipeline definition (`.tekton/hypershell-<component>-main-pull-request.yaml`), or the root `Dockerfile` for control-plane, without touching that component's source tree
- AND Konflux therefore fires that component's on-pull-request build, because its CEL trigger matches the pipeline file itself
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow evaluates the change detection outputs
- THEN it SHALL wait for that component's on-pull-request build and consume its `on-pr-<head_sha>` image, exactly as if the component source had changed
- AND the workflow's build detection SHALL mirror each component's Konflux CEL trigger, so it never falls back to a baseline image while Konflux is building an on-pr image the PR produced

#### Scenario: Gateway Management UI Package Changed

- GIVEN the PR modifies files only in `packages/gateway-management-ui/`
- AND Konflux has built and pushed the web console image
- WHEN the e2e workflow runs
- THEN it SHALL wait for the web-console Konflux on-pull-request build
- AND it SHALL pull the Konflux-built web console image
- AND the API server and control plane SHALL use baseline registry images

#### Scenario: Merge Queue Gate

- GIVEN a pull request enters the GitHub merge queue
- AND the merge queue pushes the batched merge commit to a `gh-readonly-queue/main/...` branch
- AND the merge batch's three-dot diff against `merge_group.base_sha` includes e2e-relevant paths
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow triggers on the `merge_group` event
- THEN `plan-images` SHALL set `should_run=true`
- AND it SHALL run the Kind e2e job against the speculative merge commit
- AND for each component whose source the merge batch changed it SHALL wait for that component's dedicated merge-queue Konflux build, keyed on the merge-commit SHA (`github.sha`)
- AND components the merge batch did not change SHALL use baseline registry images
- AND the browser distributed-trace verification SHALL NOT run on `merge_group` (it is covered at pull-request time and re-verified on push to `main`)

#### Scenario: Merge Queue Skip for Irrelevant Changes

- GIVEN a pull request enters the GitHub merge queue
- AND the merge batch's three-dot diff against `merge_group.base_sha` contains only files outside the e2e-relevant component paths (for example only `docs/` or `components/sdk-typescript/`)
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow triggers on the `merge_group` event
- THEN `plan-images` SHALL set `should_run=false`
- AND the Kind e2e jobs SHALL be skipped
- AND OpenShift jobs SHALL remain skipped
- AND the `Tests CI Gate` SHALL still succeed so the merge is not blocked

#### Scenario: Merge Queue Batch With Mixed Changes

- GIVEN a docs-only pull request is batched in the merge queue with another pull request that modifies e2e-relevant paths
- WHEN the `e2e` workflow evaluates the merge_group three-dot diff against `merge_group.base_sha`
- THEN `plan-images` SHALL set `should_run=true`
- AND the Kind e2e job SHALL run against the speculative merge commit that contains both pull requests

#### Scenario: Merge Queue Images Are Distinct and Ephemeral

- GIVEN the merge queue builds images through the dedicated Konflux merge-queue pipelines (`.tekton/hypershell-<component>-main-merge-queue.yaml`)
- WHEN a merge-queue pipeline fires on a push whose target branch starts with `gh-readonly-queue/main/`
- THEN it SHALL push an ephemeral `on-merge-queue-<merge_sha>` image tag (`image-expires-after` set) that is distinct from the pull-request pipelines' `on-pr-<head_sha>` tag, so a merge-queue build is never confused with an already-tested PR image
- AND the merge-queue pipeline SHALL NOT auto-release (`release.appstudio.openshift.io/auto-release: "false"`)
- AND the pull-request pipelines SHALL fire only on the `pull_request` event, not on merge-queue pushes

#### Scenario: Workflow Timeout

- GIVEN the e2e job starts
- WHEN the total job runtime exceeds 20 minutes
- THEN the job SHALL be terminated with a timeout failure

### Requirement: Konflux Image Consumption

The CI workflow SHALL NOT build component images itself. Images are built by Konflux (the existing build pipeline). The e2e workflow SHALL gate on Konflux builds completing, then pull the built images by digest into the Kind cluster. Unchanged components SHALL use baseline images from the container registry. This avoids duplicating the build step and ensures the images tested in CI are identical to the images that ship. This is expected to cover HYPERSHELL-16.

#### Scenario: Single Component Changed

- GIVEN the PR modifies files only in `components/api-server/`
- AND Konflux has built and pushed the API server image
- WHEN the e2e workflow runs
- THEN it SHALL pull the Konflux-built API server image by digest
- AND the control plane and web console SHALL use baseline registry images

#### Scenario: Multiple Components Changed

- GIVEN the PR modifies files in `components/api-server/` AND `components/control-plane/`
- AND Konflux has built both images
- WHEN the e2e workflow runs
- THEN it SHALL pull both Konflux-built images by digest

#### Scenario: Image Override via Make Target (Local/Dev)

- GIVEN a developer wants to test specific Konflux-built images locally
- WHEN they run `make kind-up` with image overrides (e.g., `IMAGE_TAG=sha256:abc123` or per-component image variables)
- THEN the Kind cluster SHALL deploy using the specified images
- AND no local image build or `kind load` step SHALL be required
- NOTE: the CI workflow does not use this path -- it creates the cluster with baseline images via `make kind-up` and swaps in Konflux-built digests afterward via `scripts/kind/set-component-images.sh`, once each changed component's build has concluded, so cluster creation overlaps the Konflux builds instead of waiting on them first

### Requirement: CI Artifact Collection

On test failure, the CI workflow SHALL collect diagnostic artifacts to aid debugging. On success, no artifacts SHALL be uploaded.

#### Scenario: Failure Diagnostics

- GIVEN an e2e test failure
- WHEN the workflow reaches its post-test phase
- THEN it SHALL collect diagnostics inside collapsible `::group::` sections for readable CI output:
  - All pods across all namespaces (`kubectl get pods -A -o wide`)
  - Pod descriptions from the HyperShell namespace (`kubectl describe pods`)
  - Pod logs from all HyperShell components (`kubectl logs --all-containers --prefix --tail=200`)
  - Keycloak logs (`kubectl logs -l app=keycloak -n keycloak`)
  - Cluster events sorted by timestamp (`kubectl get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp`)
  - Gateway API resources (Gateways, GRPCRoutes, HTTPRoutes) and managed namespace resources
- AND each section SHALL be written to both stdout (via `tee`) and a file in `e2e-diagnostics/`
- AND upload them as a GitHub Actions artifact named `e2e-diagnostics`

#### Scenario: Success -- No Artifacts

- GIVEN all e2e tests pass
- WHEN the workflow completes
- THEN no diagnostic artifacts SHALL be uploaded

### Requirement: Deploy Base/Overlay Structure

The `deploy/` directory SHALL use a kustomize base/overlay structure to support multiple infrastructure targets. Shared resources SHALL live in `deploy/base/`; infrastructure-specific additions SHALL live in per-driver overlays (`deploy/kind/`, `deploy/openshift/`).

#### Scenario: Kind Overlay

- GIVEN `deploy/kind/kustomization.yaml` references `../base` as a resource
- WHEN `kustomize build deploy/kind/` is executed
- THEN the output SHALL include all base resources (namespace, postgres, api-server, controller, controller-rbac, web-console)
- AND Kind-specific resources: networking Gateway with `gatewayClassName: cloud-provider-kind`, cert-manager certificates for `*.hypershell.localhost` and `*.gw.localhost`, HTTPRoutes for component services, CoreDNS Corefile, OIDC secrets, and Kustomize patches for OIDC configuration (JWT flags, Keycloak hostname, control-plane and web-console OIDC env vars)
- AND the Kind overlay SHALL NOT patch `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_INTERVAL` or `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_GRACE_PERIOD`; long-mode e2e applies those via `configure_namespace_gc_timing` and restores them via `restore_namespace_gc_timing`

#### Scenario: OpenShift Overlay

- GIVEN `deploy/openshift/kustomization.yaml` references `../base` as a resource
- WHEN `kustomize build deploy/openshift/` is executed
- THEN the output SHALL include all base resources
- AND OpenShift-specific resources: Routes for the API server, web console, and Keycloak with edge TLS termination; SecurityContextConstraints RoleBindings; `keycloak-allow-platform` NetworkPolicy so platform pods can reach Keycloak on TCP/8080
- AND the API server Deployment SHALL set `API_ENV=development_oidc` (the overlay, not the lifecycle script)
- AND `make openshift-up` SHALL rewrite overlay namespaces so `hypershell-system` maps to `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` and `keycloak` maps to `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak`, prefix cluster-scoped RBAC names with `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-dev-`, and set the control plane `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` from the shared Gateway listener hostname

#### Scenario: Base Resource Propagation

- GIVEN a new resource is added to `deploy/base/kustomization.yaml`
- WHEN either overlay is built
- THEN the new resource SHALL appear in both overlay outputs without duplication

#### Scenario: Image Portability

- GIVEN the base resources reference container images
- WHEN an overlay is built
- THEN image references SHALL be configurable via kustomize `images` transformers or environment variable substitution, allowing each overlay to use different registries or tags

### Requirement: Backward Compatibility

The refactored deploy structure SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows. `make kind-up` SHALL continue to work as before and SHALL additionally accept image overrides for CI use.

#### Scenario: Make Kind-Up Unchanged

- GIVEN the deploy directory has been restructured with base/overlays
- WHEN a developer runs `make kind-up`
- THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to the current implementation
- AND `scripts/kind/up.sh` SHALL continue to function (the migration to `kustomize build deploy/kind/` within the scripts is incremental and transparent)

#### Scenario: Make Kind-Up With Image Overrides

- GIVEN Konflux-built images are available at specific digests
- WHEN a developer or CI runs `make kind-up` with image tag or per-component image overrides (e.g., `IMAGE_TAG=<digest>`)
- THEN the Kind cluster SHALL deploy using the specified images instead of the default registry tags
- AND no local build step SHALL be required

## Environment Variables

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` | (auto-detected from KUBECONFIG context) | Infra driver override: `kind` or `openshift` |
| `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` | current `oc project` | Platform namespace the OpenShift driver and `make openshift-up` target; Keycloak is `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` |
| `E2E_NAMESPACE` | `openshell-e2e` | Namespace for e2e test resources (gateway deployment) |
| `E2E_GATEWAY_NAME` | `e2e-gw` | Gateway name for the e2e test |
| `E2E_MODE` | `long` | Run depth: `long` runs every step; `short` runs the essential steps of each area, owns and tears down its own gateway, and runs as a single identity (self-contained full-lifecycle check, safe against a live env); `perf` runs the same essential subset against a reused canary gateway (performance harness only) (see [E2E Short and Long Modes](#requirement-e2e-short-and-long-modes)) |
| `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds to wait for sandbox pod readiness |
| `E2E_PROVISION_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds to wait for gateway provisioning |
| `E2E_GC_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds to wait for the managed namespace to be garbage collected after a gateway delete |
| `E2E_ORPHAN_GC_TIMEOUT` | `90` | Seconds from orphan namespace seed time for the periodic reaper to delete the synthetic orphan (validated in step 11) |
| `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP` | `0` | Set to `1` to keep test resources after run |
| `E2E_OIDC_USERNAME` | `admin` | Admin OIDC user (member of `hypershell-admins` + `hypershell-users`) used for areas 1--8 and 11 |
| `E2E_OIDC_PASSWORD` | `admin` | Password for the admin OIDC user (developer-owned default). Unused when `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials`. A password-grant run against a CI-owned `pr-*` environment SHALL read Secret `hypershell-e2e-test-users` instead of this default (`ephemeral-test-credentials.spec.md`) |
| `E2E_OIDC_GRANT` | `password` | Token grant for `acquire_oidc_token` and `acquire_gateway_token_with_role`: `password` (Kind and manual OpenShift) or `client_credentials` (GitHub-brokered pull-request environments, see `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`) |
| `E2E_SEED_CLUSTER_NAME` | `local-kind` on kind; `local-openshift` on openshift; unset otherwise | Pin seed discovery to this managed-cluster name. Unset means the first list item |
| `E2E_SEED_RELEASE_NAME` | `dev-release` on kind and openshift; unset otherwise | Pin seed discovery to this gateway-release name. Unset means the first list item |
| `E2E_DEV_USERNAME` | `developer` | Standard OIDC user (`openshell-user` tier) used for the RBAC boundary assertions |
| `E2E_DEV_PASSWORD` | `developer` | Password for the developer OIDC user (local dev only) |
| `OPENSHELL_BIN` | `openshell` | Path to the openshell CLI binary |
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | (set by the suite) | Path to the extracted cluster CA so the openshell CLI trusts the gateway's TLS cert (replaces the removed `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_INSECURE` bypass) |
| `E2E_CONSOLE_URL` | `https://console.hypershell.localhost` | Base URL of the deployed web console for the browser trace verification |
| `E2E_JAEGER_URL` | `https://jaeger.hypershell.localhost` | Base URL of the Jaeger query API queried by the trace verification |

### Requirement: OIDC Authentication in E2E Tests

The e2e test suite SHALL run with OIDC authentication enabled. `make kind-up` enables OIDC unconditionally (`API_ENV=development_oidc`); there is no `KIND_ENABLE_OIDC` toggle. All API calls SHALL be authenticated with a Bearer token obtained from Keycloak. This ensures e2e tests exercise the same authentication path as production.

The test suite SHALL verify OIDC integration as part of its standard flow:
1. Acquire a token from Keycloak and authenticate all API calls
2. Verify unauthenticated API requests are rejected with 401
3. Verify the BFF `/auth/login` endpoint redirects to Keycloak with PKCE parameters
4. Verify the BFF `/auth/session` endpoint returns `{ "authenticated": false }` without a session
5. Verify the control plane's gRPC watch streams are active (no `Unauthenticated` errors in logs)

#### Scenario: API JWT Rejection

- GIVEN the API server is running with `API_ENV=development_oidc`
- WHEN an unauthenticated GET is made to `/api/hypershell/v1/gateways`
- THEN the response SHALL be 401 Unauthorized

#### Scenario: Authenticated API Calls

- GIVEN a valid OIDC token has been acquired via `acquire_oidc_token`
- WHEN API calls are made with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- THEN the API server SHALL accept the requests

#### Scenario: BFF OIDC Endpoints

- WHEN `GET /auth/login` is requested from the web console
- THEN the response SHALL be 302 with a Location header pointing to the Keycloak authorization endpoint with PKCE parameters (`code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method=S256`)

#### Scenario: BFF Session Contract

- WHEN `GET /auth/session` is requested without a session cookie
- THEN the response SHALL contain `{ "authenticated": false }`

#### Scenario: Control Plane gRPC Auth

- WHEN the control plane logs are inspected
- THEN there SHALL be no `Unauthenticated` gRPC errors

#### Scenario: CI Deployment

- GIVEN the CI e2e workflow
- WHEN the Kind cluster is created
- THEN `make kind-up` SHALL enable OIDC (the Kind overlay always sets `API_ENV=development_oidc`)

### Requirement: Web Console Distributed Trace Verification

The CI e2e workflow SHALL verify web console distributed tracing end to end, satisfying `web-console/tracing.spec.md` (`WEB-TRACE-11`). The Kind cluster SHALL be created with tracing enabled (`KIND_JAEGER=true`) so Jaeger is deployed and the web-console BFF exports to it. After the bash suite runs, the workflow SHALL drive a representative gateway workflow through a real browser against the deployed console and assert that Jaeger holds one trace joining the browser and the BFF. The check SHALL use the same Node and Chromium setup as the web-console lint job and SHALL run from the deployed console, not a mocked dev server. The trace check SHALL fail the workflow if no cross-service trace appears within a bounded polling window, and failure diagnostics SHALL include Jaeger workload status and logs and the web-console tracing configuration.

#### Scenario: Tracing Enabled for E2E

- GIVEN the CI e2e workflow
- WHEN the Kind cluster is created
- THEN `make kind-up` SHALL be invoked with `KIND_JAEGER=true`
- AND Jaeger SHALL be deployed and the web-console BFF SHALL be configured to export to it

#### Scenario: Cross-Service Trace Asserted

- GIVEN the cluster is running with tracing enabled and the console is reachable
- WHEN the trace verification drives a gateway workflow in a real browser and queries Jaeger
- THEN it SHALL find one trace whose spans include a bounded browser workflow span and the BFF server span joined by the same trace identifier
- AND the workflow SHALL fail if no such trace appears within the polling window

#### Scenario: Trace Failure Diagnostics

- GIVEN the trace verification fails
- WHEN the workflow reaches its post-test phase
- THEN it SHALL collect Jaeger workload status and logs and the web-console tracing configuration alongside the existing diagnostics

## Performance Testing

The performance test measures how the platform behaves when many gateways run at the same time. It provisions a large fleet of gateways on the target cluster in batches. After every batch it runs a fast mini test (the e2e suite in perf mode against a canary gateway) and appends a checkpoint record to the results, so a regression is pinned to the scale at which it appears rather than surfacing only at the end. Once the fleet is fully provisioned it runs the full functional e2e suite to confirm the platform still works correctly under that load. A user runs the test with `make e2e-performance`.

The performance test reuses the e2e driver abstraction. It runs against any infrastructure target that supplies a driver. It auto-detects the target from the current KUBECONFIG context, the same as the e2e suite, with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` available as an override. A user runs the test against Kind for local checks. A user runs the test against any OpenShift cluster for on-demand load tests.

The performance test does not build images and does not create the cluster. It targets a cluster that already runs. It reuses the resources that `make kind-up` (or the OpenShift deploy) already seeded: one managed cluster, one release, and one managed database. Each perf gateway create body reuses the cluster and release ids.

```

The harness holds no infrastructure-specific logic. It calls only driver interface functions for infrastructure operations. This is the same rule the e2e suite follows. A new infrastructure target needs only a new driver file, not a change to the harness.

### Requirement: Performance Test Entry Point

The system SHALL provide a `make e2e-performance` target. The target SHALL run `tests/e2e/e2e-performance.sh`. The target SHALL auto-detect the driver from the current KUBECONFIG context, the same pattern as the `make e2e` target. A user SHALL be able to override the driver on the command line with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER`. This lets the same target run against any OpenShift cluster (see [Custom OpenShift Runs](#requirement-custom-openshift-runs)).

#### Scenario: Local Kind Run

- GIVEN a developer has a running Kind cluster from `make kind-up`
- WHEN the developer runs `make e2e-performance` with no `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` set
- THEN the harness SHALL auto-detect and run with the `kind` driver
- AND it SHALL provision `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` gateways and report performance metrics

#### Scenario: OpenShift Run

- GIVEN a user is logged in to an OpenShift cluster with HyperShell deployed
- AND the `openshift` driver is present at `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh`
- WHEN the user runs `make e2e-performance` with no `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` set, or runs `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift make e2e-performance` explicitly
- THEN the harness SHALL run against the OpenShift cluster with no change to the harness code
- AND all infrastructure operations SHALL use the OpenShift driver (`oc`, Routes)

### Requirement: Infra-Agnostic Performance Harness

The performance harness (`tests/e2e/e2e-performance.sh`) SHALL be infrastructure-agnostic. It SHALL call only the driver interface functions for infrastructure operations. It SHALL select the driver the same way the e2e suite does: auto-detected from the current KUBECONFIG context, with `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` as an override. It SHALL exit with a non-zero status at startup if `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` names a missing driver, and SHALL list the available drivers. It SHALL NOT contain any `kubectl`-only, `oc`-only, or `kind`-only command.

The harness SHALL obtain the seeded cluster, release, and managed database ids the same way the e2e suite does: it SHALL query the API through `api_curl` and reuse the shared seeding helpers in `tests/e2e/lib.sh`, never hardcoding ids. When `E2E_SEED_CLUSTER_NAME` / `E2E_SEED_RELEASE_NAME` are set, discovery SHALL select the matching name; when they are unset it SHALL take the first list item (the single-seed Kind/CI layout). On `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=kind` those names SHALL default to the `make kind-up` seeds (`local-kind`, `dev-release`). On `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift` they SHALL default to the `make openshift-seed` names (`local-openshift`, `dev-release`). When discovery cannot resolve both ids, it SHALL report whether each list body was an empty collection, an API `Error` (code and reason), or unparseable, and SHALL hint to re-run `SEED_STRICT=true make openshift-seed` (or `make kind-seed`). Every diagnostic or resource-inspection command SHALL invoke the Kubernetes CLI through `$(get_cli_binary)`, so it resolves to `kubectl` on Kind and `oc` on OpenShift with no change to the harness.

The OpenShift driver is specified alongside this contract in `openshift-development.spec.md`; the performance harness uses it for OpenShift runs (see [Scope](#scope)). The harness SHALL contain no infra-specific code: it works with either driver with no change. OpenShift runs are manual and on-demand; the performance test is not wired into CI for any target (see [Design Decisions](#design-decisions)).

#### Scenario: Unknown Driver Override

- GIVEN `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=nonexistent`
- WHEN the performance harness starts
- THEN it SHALL exit with a non-zero status
- AND print the available drivers from `tests/e2e/drivers/*.sh`

#### Scenario: No Infra-Specific Command in the Harness

- GIVEN the harness source `tests/e2e/e2e-performance.sh`
- WHEN a reviewer inspects it for infrastructure operations
- THEN every infrastructure operation SHALL go through a driver function
- AND no `kubectl`-only, `oc`-only, or `kind`-only command SHALL appear in the harness itself (CLI calls go through `$(get_cli_binary)`)

### Requirement: Gateway Fleet Scale-Up

The harness SHALL provision `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` gateways on the target cluster. It SHALL provision them in batches of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE`, running a checkpoint mini test after each batch (see [Incremental Scale-Up Checkpoints](#requirement-incremental-scale-up-checkpoints)). Within a batch it SHALL create the gateways with bounded concurrency, capped at `E2E_PERF_CONCURRENCY`. Bounded concurrency prevents a thundering herd against the API server and the control plane. Each gateway SHALL use a deterministic name: `<E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_PREFIX>-<index>`. Each gateway create body SHALL reuse the seeded cluster, release, and managed database ids, the same as the e2e suite. The harness SHALL follow a reuse-or-create pattern: an existing gateway with the same name SHALL be reused, not duplicated. This makes the test safe to re-run.

The harness SHALL wait until each gateway reaches `Running` phase, or until `E2E_PERF_PROVISION_TIMEOUT` seconds pass. It SHALL record the create latency and the time-to-`Running` for each gateway. A gateway that does not reach `Running` in time SHALL count as a failed provision, but SHALL NOT stop the run: the harness reports it in the metrics.

#### Scenario: Fleet Provisioned

- GIVEN a running target cluster with the seeded managed cluster, release, and managed database
- WHEN the harness runs the scale-up phase with `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT=N`
- THEN it SHALL create N gateways named `<prefix>-1` through `<prefix>-N`
- AND it SHALL wait until each gateway reports `Running` phase or the provision timeout elapses

#### Scenario: Bounded Concurrency Respected

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_CONCURRENCY=C`
- WHEN the harness provisions the fleet
- THEN it SHALL run at most C create-and-wait operations at the same time

#### Scenario: Re-Run Reuses Existing Gateways

- GIVEN a prior run left perf gateways in place (`E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP=1`)
- WHEN the harness runs again with the same prefix and count
- THEN it SHALL reuse the existing gateways by name
- AND it SHALL NOT create duplicate gateways

### Requirement: Incremental Scale-Up Checkpoints

The harness SHALL validate the platform incrementally as the fleet grows, so a scale problem is caught as it appears rather than only at the end. It SHALL provision the fleet in batches of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` (default 5; a value of 5--10 is recommended). After each batch reaches `Running` (or times out), the harness SHALL run a checkpoint mini test and SHALL append one checkpoint record to the run results before starting the next batch. This means the results file is written incrementally across the run, not only at teardown.

The checkpoint mini test SHALL be the e2e suite run in **perf mode** (`E2E_MODE=perf`, see [E2E Short and Long Modes](#requirement-e2e-short-and-long-modes)), not the full suite (running every step of all 11 areas after every batch would dominate the run). Perf mode runs the essential (`short`-tagged) steps of every area -- so the checkpoint touches a slice of each portion of the test -- while long mode (the default, used for the final run) runs all steps. This reuses the suite's real assertions and driver code; the harness adds no separate probe.

The mini test SHALL run against a dedicated **canary** gateway that the harness provisions once during preflight and whose per-gateway OIDC role it grants once (through the driver's `acquire_gateway_token_with_role` helper, so the harness still calls only driver interface functions), so no batch pays repeated Keycloak setup or gateway provisioning. The canary is separate from the counted fleet and is named `<E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_PREFIX>-canary`. The checkpoint SHALL invoke perf mode with `E2E_GATEWAY_NAME=<prefix>-canary` and `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` so the suite reuses the canary and does not tear it down between batches. These two variables SHALL be set only on the child suite invocation (for example prefixed on the command line), NOT exported into the harness environment; the harness's own `EXIT` trap therefore still runs and deletes the canary and the whole fleet at teardown (see [Performance Test Cleanup](#requirement-performance-test-cleanup)).

Each checkpoint record SHALL capture the cumulative number of gateways `Running`, the time-to-`Running` latency percentiles for the batch just added, the mode run (`perf`), the mini-test duration in seconds, the mini-test result (`pass`/`fail`), and a timestamp.

A user SHALL be able to disable checkpoints by setting `E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT=0`, in which case the harness provisions the full fleet in one pass and records no checkpoint entries. When a checkpoint mini test fails and `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=1` (the default), the harness SHALL stop scaling, record the cumulative gateway count as the breaking scale, run the failure diagnostics, and proceed to reporting and teardown; the run SHALL then be a failure. When `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=0`, the harness SHALL record the failed checkpoint and continue scaling, so a user can observe whether the platform recovers at a higher scale.

Setting `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` greater than or equal to `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` provisions the fleet in a single batch with one final checkpoint, which is equivalent to the non-incremental behavior.

#### Scenario: Checkpoint After Each Batch

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT=20` and `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE=5`
- WHEN the harness runs the scale-up phase
- THEN it SHALL run the e2e suite in perf mode after each batch of 5 gateways reaches `Running`
- AND it SHALL append a checkpoint record (cumulative count, batch latency percentiles, mode, mini-test duration, mini-test result) after each batch

#### Scenario: Canary Provisioned Once

- GIVEN checkpoints are enabled (`E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT=1`)
- WHEN the harness runs the preflight phase
- THEN it SHALL provision one canary gateway named `<prefix>-canary` and grant its OIDC role once
- AND each checkpoint mini test SHALL reuse that canary without re-granting the role

#### Scenario: Early Stop on Checkpoint Failure

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=1` (default)
- WHEN a checkpoint mini test fails at cumulative count `K`
- THEN the harness SHALL stop scaling before the next batch
- AND it SHALL record `K` as the breaking scale, run diagnostics, and fail the run

#### Scenario: Continue Past Checkpoint Failure

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=0`
- WHEN a checkpoint mini test fails at cumulative count `K`
- THEN the harness SHALL record the failed checkpoint and continue provisioning the remaining batches

#### Scenario: Checkpoints Disabled

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT=0`
- WHEN the harness runs the scale-up phase
- THEN it SHALL provision the full fleet without running checkpoint mini tests
- AND the results SHALL contain an empty `checkpoints` array

### Requirement: E2E Short and Long Modes

The e2e suite (`tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh`) SHALL support three run depths selected by `E2E_MODE`: `long` (the default), `short`, and `perf`. The depth is chosen per step, not per area: each area's checks SHALL be organized as named steps, and each step SHALL declare the minimum mode it belongs to. A step tagged `short` runs in every mode; a step tagged `long` runs only in long mode. Long mode therefore runs every step (the current full behavior), and both `short` and `perf` run the `short`-tagged subset of every area -- a slice of each portion of the test, exercising each area's essential path while skipping its deep or slow steps.

When `E2E_MODE` is unset or `long`, the suite SHALL run every step, so existing invocations (the CI e2e job and the final run of the performance test) are unchanged. When `E2E_MODE=short` or `E2E_MODE=perf`, the suite SHALL run only the `short`-tagged steps, in the suite's normal order. The suite SHALL exit non-zero if `E2E_MODE` is set to any value other than `short`, `perf`, or `long`. The tags SHALL live in the suite so all modes run the same assertion code; there SHALL be no second copy of any check.

`short` is the canonical quick check. It owns the gateway it creates and SHALL tear it fully down at the end (the same delete-driven namespace-GC path a long run uses for its own gateway), leaving nothing behind. `short` is therefore a self-contained, non-destructive full-lifecycle check -- create, run, interact, delete -- safe to run repeatedly against a live or shared environment: a post-rollout promotion gate, synthetic monitoring, or a post-deploy sanity check.

`short` additionally runs as a single identity: it SHALL NOT impersonate other users (token-exchange with `requested_subject`), so it SHALL skip the developer RBAC area (area 9), which mints a token for a second principal. This keeps the check minimal-privilege -- its OIDC client needs only `gateway:creator` and `hypershell-users` (plus same-subject token-exchange for the per-gateway audience), not `platform:admin` or an impersonation policy -- so it is safe as a live-environment promotion gate. The suite SHALL express this through a mode predicate (`e2e_multi_identity`), false for `short` and true for `perf` and `long`; any step that acts as a principal other than the run's own identity SHALL gate on it. The platform-admin area (area 10) is long-only and so is already skipped in `short`.

`perf` runs the same `short`-tagged step subset but is tailored to the performance harness (see [Incremental Scale-Up Checkpoints](#requirement-incremental-scale-up-checkpoints)) and SHALL be used only from `e2e-performance.sh`. It differs from `short` in two ways: it follows the harness's reuse-or-preserve pattern -- it may reuse a supplied long-lived canary gateway and SHALL NOT tear it down, so the canary survives repeated checkpoints -- and it exercises the multi-identity developer RBAC path (area 9). It is not a live-environment gate; it assumes the harness owns the canary's lifecycle.

Short mode SHALL stay fast enough to run after every scale-up batch. The table below maps every one of the 11 areas (see [E2E Test Suite Coverage](#requirement-e2e-test-suite-coverage)) to its short and long-only steps:

| Area | Short (essential steps) | Long-only (deep / slow steps) |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1. OIDC authentication | acquire the admin token via `acquire_oidc_token` | n/a (every run needs a token) |
| 2. Gateway provisioning | reuse-or-create the gateway, wait `Running` | n/a (both modes need a running gateway) |
| 3. Infrastructure verification | deployment and service present and healthy | TLS secret, certgen job, and NetworkPolicy assertions |
| 4. Token + CA trust | fetch token and CA bundle, establish trusted TLS | n/a |
| 5. Route discovery + CLI registration | discover the endpoint, register the openshell CLI | n/a |
| 6. Connectivity | one route reachability check | n/a |
| 7. Sandbox lifecycle | one sandbox create -> ready -> delete, `active_sandbox_count` = 1 then 0 | second concurrent sandbox to assert the count increments |
| 8. Sandbox interaction | one in-sandbox exec (`uname -a`) | the remaining exec commands (`ls /workspace`) |
| 9. Developer RBAC | short: skipped (single-identity; no impersonation). perf: one boundary assertion (developer 403 on gateway create) | full developer membership + allowed-action matrix |
| 10. Platform-admin RBAC | n/a; skipped in short and perf (its assertion deletes a gateway) | full platform-admin matrix, including gateway deletion |
| 11. Namespace GC | short: delete-driven GC of the run's own gateway. perf: delete-driven GC with a bounded wait, on a throwaway gateway (not the reused canary) | periodic-reaper orphan GC over the full timeout window; delete-driven GC of the run's own gateway |

`short` mode SHALL own the gateway it provisions: it SHALL delete that gateway at the end and assert its namespace is garbage collected (the same delete-driven GC path area 11 runs for a long run's own gateway), and its cleanup path SHALL also delete the gateway on any exit, so a short run leaves nothing behind. Short mode SHALL NOT seed or wait on the synthetic orphan namespace (that periodic-reaper assertion is long-only) and SHALL NOT mutate shared controller state (namespace-GC timing is adjusted only for long runs). Any long-only step that deletes the run's own gateway as part of the RBAC matrix SHALL NOT run in short or perf mode; area 11's own-gateway deletion, being the assertion itself, SHALL run in short and long but not perf.

`perf` mode SHALL follow the reuse-or-create pattern the harness relies on: when `E2E_GATEWAY_NAME` names an existing gateway it SHALL reuse that gateway rather than provision a new one, and it SHALL NOT delete it at the end (so a reused canary survives repeated perf runs). This constraint governs the two areas that would otherwise tear a gateway down: the platform-admin RBAC area (area 10) SHALL NOT run its gateway-deletion step in short or perf mode, and the namespace-GC area (area 11) SHALL, in perf mode, exercise delete-driven GC against a throwaway gateway it creates, never against the supplied canary. Creating that throwaway gateway SHALL reuse the seeded `cluster_id` and `release_id`. The suite SHALL take cluster and release ids from the environment when a parent (the performance harness) forwards them, from the reused gateway's JSON when that gateway already exists, or by discovering them from the API when either is missing.

#### Scenario: Perf Mode Throwaway Uses Seed Ids

- GIVEN `E2E_MODE=perf` and a reused canary gateway
- WHEN the suite creates the namespace-GC throwaway gateway
- THEN it SHALL POST that gateway with the seeded cluster and release ids
- AND it SHALL NOT fail with unknown seed ids when the parent forwarded those ids or the reused gateway JSON contains them

#### Scenario: Long Mode by Default

- GIVEN `E2E_MODE` is unset
- WHEN the e2e suite runs
- THEN it SHALL run every step of every area, the same as before mode selection existed

#### Scenario: Short Mode Runs the Short Slice and Owns Its Gateway

- GIVEN `E2E_MODE=short`
- WHEN the e2e suite runs
- THEN it SHALL run the `short`-tagged steps of every area and skip the `long`-only steps (for example the second sandbox and the full RBAC matrix)
- AND it SHALL skip the developer RBAC area (area 9), running as a single identity without impersonation
- AND it SHALL delete the gateway it created and assert its namespace is garbage collected
- AND it SHALL NOT seed the synthetic orphan namespace or mutate shared namespace-GC timing
- AND it SHALL leave no gateway behind on any exit

#### Scenario: Perf Mode Runs the Short Slice Against a Reused Canary

- GIVEN `E2E_MODE=perf` and a supplied canary gateway
- WHEN the e2e suite runs
- THEN it SHALL run the `short`-tagged steps of every area and skip the `long`-only steps
- AND it SHALL reuse the supplied gateway and SHALL NOT delete it
- AND it SHALL exercise the developer RBAC area (area 9)

#### Scenario: Invalid Mode Fails Fast

- GIVEN `E2E_MODE=medium`
- WHEN the e2e suite starts
- THEN it SHALL exit non-zero and state that the valid modes are `short`, `perf`, and `long`

### Requirement: Functional Validation Under Load

After the fleet is fully provisioned, the harness SHALL run the functional e2e suite (`tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh`) against the target cluster as the final, comprehensive gate. Where the per-batch checkpoint runs the suite in perf mode (see [E2E Short and Long Modes](#requirement-e2e-short-and-long-modes)), this phase runs it in long mode -- every step of all 11 areas -- to confirm the platform still works correctly while the large gateway fleet runs. The functional suite SHALL use a dedicated gateway name (`E2E_PERF_FUNCTIONAL_GATEWAY_NAME`, default `perf-e2e-gw`) so it does not collide with the perf fleet or the canary. The functional suite SHALL use the same `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER`. The functional suite exits non-zero when any of its checks fail. The harness SHALL treat that non-zero exit as a performance test failure.

A user SHALL be able to skip the functional phase by setting `E2E_PERF_RUN_FUNCTIONAL=0`. This supports pure load measurement without the functional gate.

#### Scenario: Suite Passes Under Load

- GIVEN the perf fleet is provisioned and running
- WHEN the harness runs `tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` with `E2E_GATEWAY_NAME=perf-e2e-gw`
- THEN the functional suite SHALL exit `0`
- AND the harness SHALL record the functional phase as a pass

#### Scenario: Suite Failure Fails the Run

- GIVEN the perf fleet is provisioned
- WHEN the functional suite exits non-zero (one or more checks failed)
- THEN the harness SHALL record the functional phase as a failure
- AND the performance test SHALL exit with a non-zero status

#### Scenario: Functional Phase Skipped

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_RUN_FUNCTIONAL=0`
- WHEN the harness finishes the scale-up phase
- THEN it SHALL NOT run the functional suite
- AND it SHALL still report the scale-up metrics

### Requirement: Performance Metrics and Reporting

The harness SHALL compute and report metrics for the scale-up phase:

- total gateways requested, provisioned, and failed
- provisioning success rate (percent)
- average time-to-`Running` latency plus p50, p90, p99, and max
- provisioning throughput (gateways that reached `Running` per minute of wall-clock scale-up)
- total wall-clock time for the scale-up phase, printed as `HH:MM:SS` (JSON still stores `wall_clock_seconds` as a number of seconds)
- the per-batch checkpoint series (cumulative count, batch latency percentiles, mode, perf e2e duration, and perf e2e result per checkpoint)

The human-readable stdout summary is the primary digest: a user reads it right after a run. The harness SHALL print an aligned summary table to stdout. Label columns SHALL be wide enough that values share one vertical gutter; the checkpoint table SHALL size each column to at least its header so headers and values line up. Checkpoint `mode` and `result` SHALL be unquoted (`perf`, `fail`), not JSON fragments (`perf"`, `fail"`). Throughput SHALL be labeled `gateways / min` so the unit is explicit: provisioned gateways divided by scale-up wall-clock minutes. The checkpoint table SHALL include one row per batch so a user can see how latency and the perf e2e result track with the growing fleet. The harness SHALL also write a machine-readable JSON summary for tooling (see [Performance Results Consumption](#requirement-performance-results-consumption)).

#### Scenario: Metrics Printed

- GIVEN the scale-up phase has finished with a 92-second wall clock and a failed perf e2e checkpoint
- WHEN the harness reaches its report phase
- THEN it SHALL print the success rate, the latency percentiles, and the throughput to stdout as an aligned table
- AND wall clock SHALL be printed as `00:01:32`
- AND throughput SHALL be labeled `gateways / min`
- AND the checkpoint row SHALL show `perf` and `fail` without trailing quotes

#### Scenario: JSON Summary Written

- GIVEN the report phase runs
- WHEN it writes results
- THEN it SHALL write a JSON summary file under `E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR`
- AND the JSON SHALL follow the documented schema (see [Performance Results Consumption](#requirement-performance-results-consumption))

### Requirement: Performance SLO Gating

The harness SHALL support optional pass/fail thresholds. The thresholds SHALL be off by default, so a plain run only reports metrics. When a user sets `E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE`, the harness SHALL fail the run if the provisioning success rate is below that value. When a user sets `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99`, the harness SHALL fail the run if the p99 time-to-`Running` is above that value. This lets a manual or on-demand run gate on a performance regression without a change to the harness.

#### Scenario: Success Rate Below Threshold

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE=95`
- WHEN the provisioning success rate is below 95 percent
- THEN the harness SHALL exit with a non-zero status

#### Scenario: p99 Above Threshold

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99=300`
- WHEN the p99 time-to-`Running` is above 300 seconds
- THEN the harness SHALL exit with a non-zero status

#### Scenario: No Thresholds Set

- GIVEN neither `E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE` nor `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99` is set
- WHEN the harness finishes the scale-up phase
- THEN it SHALL report the metrics
- AND it SHALL NOT fail on the metrics themselves: with no SLO thresholds set, the run's result is decided only by the other fail conditions -- a failing checkpoint mini test when `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=1` (the default), or a non-zero exit from the functional suite
- AND a failed provision SHALL affect only the metrics and any SLOs (it lowers the success rate and can raise p99); it SHALL NOT by itself fail the run or abort scale-up

### Requirement: Performance Results Consumption

The performance test is run locally or against any OpenShift cluster, not in CI (see [Design Decisions](#design-decisions)). The results SHALL therefore be easy to digest from a terminal, with no CI service required. Three things support this: a stable JSON schema, per-run history files, and a local report target.

**Stable, versioned JSON schema.** The harness SHALL write the run summary as JSON with a top-level `schema_version` string. The schema SHALL be documented in this spec, so `jq` filters keep working across runs. The JSON SHALL contain the driver, the run timestamps, the run config (including the checkpoint and SLO flags the run used), the scale-up metrics (including both create-latency and time-to-`Running` percentiles), the per-batch checkpoint series, the functional result, the SLO result, and the overall result. The shape SHALL be:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "driver": "kind",
  "started_at": "2026-08-21T15:30:00Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-08-21T15:41:12Z",

    "throughput_per_min": 2.34,
    "create_latency_seconds": { "avg": 0.6, "p50": 0.4, "p90": 0.8, "p99": 1.1, "max": 1.3 },
    "time_to_running_seconds": { "avg": 156, "p50": 118, "p90": 205, "p99": 233, "max": 240 },
    "stopped_early": false,
    "breaking_scale": null
  },
  "checkpoints": [
    {

      "at": "2026-08-21T15:33:10Z",
      "batch_time_to_running_seconds": { "avg": 111, "p50": 92, "p90": 140, "p99": 150, "max": 152 },
      "mode": "perf",
      "mini_test": "pass",
      "mini_test_seconds": 34
    },
    {
      "gateways_running": 10,
      "at": "2026-08-21T15:35:41Z",
      "batch_time_to_running_seconds": { "avg": 142, "p50": 110, "p90": 180, "p99": 190, "max": 192 },
      "mode": "perf",
      "mini_test": "pass",
      "mini_test_seconds": 39
    }
  ],
  "functional": { "ran": true, "passed": true, "gateway_name": "perf-e2e-gw" },
  "slo": { "min_success_rate": null, "max_provision_p99": null, "passed": true },
  "result": "pass"
}
```

A field that does not apply SHALL be `null` (for example an unset SLO threshold, or `functional` fields when `E2E_PERF_RUN_FUNCTIONAL=0` with `ran: false`). `checkpoints` SHALL be an array with one entry per completed batch, in scale order, and SHALL be empty when `E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT=0`. `scale_up.stopped_early` SHALL be `true` and `scale_up.breaking_scale` SHALL hold the cumulative gateway count when an early stop is triggered by a failing checkpoint; otherwise `stopped_early` is `false` and `breaking_scale` is `null`. A breaking change to the shape SHALL bump `schema_version`.

**Per-run history files.** The harness SHALL write each run to a new timestamped file, `<E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR>/<driver>-<UTC-timestamp>.json` (for example `perf-results/kind-20260821T153000Z.json`). It SHALL write the file incrementally: it SHALL update the file after each checkpoint so a partial result survives an interrupt or an early stop, and it SHALL finalize the file in the report phase. It SHALL NOT overwrite prior runs. This keeps a local history a user can compare across runs, the same benefit a CI trend chart gives, without a CI service. The harness MAY also write or update a `perf-results/latest.json` pointer to the most recent run for convenience.

The results directory holds local run output, not source. The default `E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR` (`perf-results/`) SHALL be gitignored, so run artifacts (JSON history and the optional CSV) are never committed.

**Local report target.** The system SHALL provide a `scripts/perf-report.sh` script and a `make e2e-performance-report` target. The report SHALL read the JSON history files under `E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR` and print an aligned table of the most recent `E2E_PERF_REPORT_LIMIT` runs (default 10), one row per run, most recent first. This lets a user spot a regression across local runs from the terminal. A field that is missing or `null` in the JSON SHALL render as `-`. That includes a partial history file written before scale-up metrics and `result` were filled (interrupt, canary failure, or crash): the row SHALL still show the timestamp, driver, and requested count when those values exist, and `-` for the rest.

Each tabulated run provisions `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` gateways (the `count` column; default 5) in batches of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` (default 5). After each batch reaches `Running` (or times out), the harness SHALL run a perf e2e test (`E2E_MODE=perf` against the canary) as the checkpoint mini test, then continue to the next batch. Set `E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT=0` to skip those per-batch perf tests and provision the fleet in one pass. With the defaults (`count=5`, `batch size=5`), a run is one batch followed by one perf e2e test, then the long functional suite. Raise `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` and keep `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` smaller to get several perf e2e checkpoints as the fleet grows (see [Incremental Scale-Up Checkpoints](#requirement-incremental-scale-up-checkpoints)).

The recent-runs table SHALL use these columns:

| Column | Source | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `timestamp` | `started_at` | UTC start time of the run |
| `driver` | `driver` | Cluster driver used (`kind`, `openshift`, and so on) |
| `count` | `config.gateway_count` | Requested fleet size, from `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` (default 5). This is the target, not how many gateways actually reached `Running`. The fleet is added in batches of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` (default 5) |
| `success%` | `scale_up.success_rate` | Share of counted gateways that reached `Running` before timeout. A failed provision lowers this number; it SHALL NOT by itself fail the run (see [Performance SLO Gating](#requirement-performance-slo-gating)) |
| `avg` | `scale_up.time_to_running_seconds.avg` | Mean time-to-`Running` in seconds (API create until the gateway is `Running`) across the whole fleet |
| `p99` | `scale_up.time_to_running_seconds.p99` | 99th-percentile time-to-`Running` in seconds, same clock as `avg` |
| `tput/min` | `scale_up.throughput_per_min` | Gateways that reached `Running` per minute of wall-clock scale-up (`provisioned / (wall_clock_seconds / 60)`). The stdout summary labels the same value `gateways / min` |
| `result` | `result` | Overall pass/fail of the run, not of provisioning. Includes the per-batch perf e2e tests and the final long functional suite |

`result` SHALL be independent of `success%`. With no SLO env vars set, the run SHALL fail when (a) the canary never reaches `Running`, (b) a per-batch perf e2e test fails and `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE=1` (the default), or (c) the functional suite (`E2E_MODE=long`) fails under load. Optional SLOs (`E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE`, `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99`) MAY also fail the run. A row with `success%` of `100.0` and `result` of `fail` therefore means every counted gateway reached `Running`, but a perf e2e checkpoint or the functional suite failed.

The report SHALL also be able to render the per-batch checkpoint series of a single run, so a user can see at which scale latency climbs or the perf e2e test starts failing within one run. A user SHALL select that single-run view by setting `E2E_PERF_REPORT_RUN` to a run's history-file path or its UTC timestamp (equivalently, passing it as the script's first argument); with no run selected the report prints the recent-runs table. Each checkpoint row is one batch of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` followed by that perf e2e test. The checkpoint table SHALL use these columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `count` | Cumulative gateways `Running` after that batch of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` |
| `batch avg` | Mean time-to-`Running` in seconds for the batch just added |
| `batch p99` | 99th-percentile time-to-`Running` in seconds for that batch |
| `mini s` | Duration of the perf e2e test (`E2E_MODE=perf`) that ran after that batch, in seconds |
| `result` | Pass/fail of that perf e2e test |

The report SHALL depend only on `bash`; it SHALL NOT require `python3`, `jq`, or any external service.

**Optional CSV export.** When `E2E_PERF_CSV=1`, the harness SHALL also write a CSV row per run to `<E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR>/history.csv` (append, with a header on first write), so a user can open the history in a spreadsheet. CSV export SHALL be off by default.

#### Scenario: JSON Follows the Documented Schema

- GIVEN a completed run
- WHEN a user reads the run's JSON file
- THEN it SHALL contain `schema_version` and the documented top-level keys (`driver`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `config`, `scale_up`, `checkpoints`, `functional`, `slo`, `result`)
- AND `jq` filters written against the documented schema SHALL succeed

#### Scenario: Checkpoint Series Written Incrementally

- GIVEN checkpoints are enabled and the harness has completed at least one batch
- WHEN a user reads the run's JSON file mid-run
- THEN it SHALL already contain a `checkpoints` entry for each completed batch
- AND if the run is later interrupted, the file SHALL retain the checkpoints written so far

#### Scenario: Runs Are Not Overwritten

- GIVEN a prior run wrote `perf-results/kind-<t1>.json`
- WHEN a new run finishes at a later time `<t2>`
- THEN it SHALL write a new file `perf-results/kind-<t2>.json`
- AND the earlier file SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Local Report Tabulates Recent Runs

- GIVEN two or more run JSON files exist under `E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR`
- WHEN a user runs `make e2e-performance-report`
- THEN it SHALL print an aligned table with one row per run, most recent first
- AND each row SHALL show the timestamp, driver, count, success rate, average, p99, throughput, and result

#### Scenario: Report Distinguishes Result From Success Rate

- GIVEN a completed run whose JSON has `scale_up.success_rate` of `100.0` and `result` of `"fail"`
- WHEN a user runs `make e2e-performance-report`
- THEN that row SHALL show `100.0` under `success%` and `fail` under `result`

#### Scenario: Partial Run Shows Dashes

- GIVEN a history file that has `started_at`, `driver`, and `config.gateway_count` but `null` or missing scale-up metrics and `result`
- WHEN a user runs `make e2e-performance-report`
- THEN that row SHALL show the timestamp, driver, and count
- AND it SHALL show `-` for success rate, average, p99, throughput, and result

#### Scenario: Report Renders a Single Run's Checkpoints

- GIVEN a run JSON file with a non-empty `checkpoints` array
- WHEN a user runs `make e2e-performance-report` with `E2E_PERF_REPORT_RUN` set to that run
- THEN it SHALL print the run's per-batch checkpoint series (cumulative count, batch average, batch p99, mini-test duration, and mini-test result per checkpoint)
- AND it SHALL NOT print the recent-runs table

#### Scenario: Report Needs No External Tooling

- GIVEN a machine with only `bash` (no `python3`, no `jq`, no network)
- WHEN a user runs `make e2e-performance-report`
- THEN it SHALL print the report without error

#### Scenario: CSV Export Opt-In

- GIVEN `E2E_PERF_CSV=1`
- WHEN a run finishes
- THEN the harness SHALL append a row to `<E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR>/history.csv`
- AND it SHALL write a header row when the file is first created

### Requirement: Performance Test Cleanup

The harness SHALL delete every gateway it created, which is (a) the counted fleet `<prefix>-1`..`<prefix>-N`, (b) the canary gateway `<prefix>-canary`, and (c) the functional gateway `E2E_PERF_FUNCTIONAL_GATEWAY_NAME` (default `perf-e2e-gw`) if it still exists. Because the checkpoint mini tests pass `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` only to the child suite (not into the harness environment), the canary survives between batches but is still deleted by this teardown. It SHALL delete the gateways with bounded concurrency, capped at `E2E_PERF_CONCURRENCY`. It SHALL run cleanup from an `EXIT` trap, so a failure or an interrupt still triggers cleanup. It SHALL poll until each managed namespace is garbage collected, the same signal the e2e suite uses (see [Gateway Deletion and Namespace GC](#requirement-gateway-deletion-and-namespace-gc)). A user SHALL be able to keep the whole fleet (including the canary and the functional gateway) by setting `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` on the harness invocation, the same variable the e2e suite uses. This helps a user inspect the cluster after a run.

#### Scenario: Fleet Deleted After Run

- GIVEN the harness provisioned a perf fleet
- WHEN the run finishes
- THEN the harness SHALL delete the counted fleet, the canary gateway, and the functional gateway it created
- AND it SHALL poll until each managed namespace is gone

#### Scenario: Cleanup on Failure

- GIVEN the harness fails during the scale-up or functional phase
- WHEN the `EXIT` trap runs
- THEN the harness SHALL still delete the perf gateways it created

#### Scenario: Cleanup Skipped

- GIVEN `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP=1`
- WHEN the run finishes
- THEN the harness SHALL keep the perf fleet in place for inspection

### Requirement: Performance Failure Diagnostics

On failure, the harness SHALL collect diagnostics that explain resource pressure. A large fleet can exhaust node CPU, memory, or pod capacity. The diagnostics SHALL include: pending pods and their reasons, node capacity and allocatable resources, the phases of the perf gateways, and control-plane logs. Every diagnostic command SHALL invoke the CLI through `$(get_cli_binary)` so it works on both Kind and OpenShift. When running under GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_ACTIONS` is set), the harness SHALL wrap the diagnostics in collapsible `::group::` sections, the same style the e2e workflow uses (see [CI Artifact Collection](#requirement-ci-artifact-collection)); for a local run it SHALL print plain, labeled sections instead. Because the performance test is not wired into CI (see [Design Decisions](#design-decisions)), the collapsible groups are a convenience when a user happens to run it under Actions, not a documented CI-output feature.

#### Scenario: Resource Pressure Surfaced

- GIVEN a scale-up failure (one or more gateways did not reach `Running`)
- WHEN the harness reaches its diagnostics phase
- THEN it SHALL report pending pods with reasons, node capacity, perf gateway phases, and control-plane logs

#### Scenario: Plain Diagnostics Locally

- GIVEN `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is not set
- WHEN the harness reaches its diagnostics phase
- THEN it SHALL print plain, labeled diagnostic sections
- AND it SHALL NOT emit `::group::` markers

### Performance Environment Variables

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT` | `5` | Fleet size for scale-up (the report `count` column). The canary and the functional gateway add two more stacks, so a run provisions `count + 2` gateways. The default suits a local Kind cluster; raise it on an OpenShift cluster with spare capacity |
| `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` | `5` | Gateways added per batch. After each batch the harness runs a perf e2e test (`E2E_MODE=perf`) against the canary (5--10 recommended) |
| `E2E_PERF_CHECKPOINT` | `1` | Run that perf e2e test after each batch (`0` provisions in one pass, no checkpoints) |
| `E2E_PERF_STOP_ON_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE` | `1` | Stop scaling and fail on a failing checkpoint (`0` records it and continues) |
| `E2E_PERF_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Max concurrent create / provision / delete operations |
| `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_PREFIX` | `perf-gw` | Name prefix for the perf gateway fleet (canary is `<prefix>-canary`) |
| `E2E_PERF_PROVISION_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds to wait for each gateway to reach `Running` under load |
| `E2E_PERF_RUN_FUNCTIONAL` | `1` | Run the e2e functional suite after scale-up (`0` to skip) |
| `E2E_PERF_FUNCTIONAL_GATEWAY_NAME` | `perf-e2e-gw` | Gateway name for the nested functional suite (avoids collision with the fleet) |
| `E2E_PERF_RESULTS_DIR` | `perf-results` | Directory for the per-run JSON history files (and optional CSV) |
| `E2E_PERF_REPORT_LIMIT` | `10` | Number of recent runs `make e2e-performance-report` tabulates |
| `E2E_PERF_REPORT_RUN` | (unset) | Select a single run (history-file path or its UTC timestamp) to render that run's per-batch checkpoint series instead of the recent-runs table |
| `E2E_PERF_CSV` | `0` | Set to `1` to also append each run to `<results-dir>/history.csv` |
| `E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE` | (unset) | Optional SLO: min provisioning success rate percent; below this fails the run |
| `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99` | (unset) | Optional SLO: max p99 time-to-`Running` seconds; above this fails the run |
| `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` | (auto-detected from KUBECONFIG context) | Infra driver override: `kind` or `openshift` |
| `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP` | `0` | Set to `1` to keep the perf fleet after the run |

**Capacity note:** a small Kind cluster cannot run hundreds of gateways. Each gateway provisions a deployment, a service, a TLS secret, a certgen job, a per-gateway Keycloak client, and a managed namespace. A run also stands up the canary and the functional gateway, so the cluster carries `E2E_PERF_GATEWAY_COUNT + 2` gateway stacks at peak: the default of 5 means 7 stacks, which fits a typical Kind cluster. Keep the total modest on Kind (roughly `count + 2` at or below 10). Use a larger count on an OpenShift cluster that has spare capacity. The harness reports resource pressure on failure so a user can find the ceiling.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Shell-based drivers as starting point | The e2e test is a shell script; shell functions provide the simplest driver abstraction without adding a new language or build step. Each driver is a single file implementing a known function interface. If the test suite grows in complexity -- structured assertions, parallel execution, direct Kubernetes API client usage -- migrating to a Go-based e2e framework (e.g., `go test` with client-go) is a natural follow-up. The driver interface contract is function-shape-agnostic, so the same logical abstraction applies in either language |
| `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` is auto-detected from the KUBECONFIG context, with an explicit override | `route.openshift.io` is a reliable, cheap signal for OpenShift, so a developer running against whichever cluster their context selects does not need to remember to set a flag. CI still sets `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=kind` explicitly so the invocation stays self-documenting and does not depend on the runner's kubeconfig |
| Tests live in `tests/e2e/`, not `components/pr-test/` | A top-level `tests/` tree is the natural home for e2e tests and their drivers. `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh` is deprecated per `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md`; the ROKS variant and the `pr_test` component stay until that spec's removal window closes |
| Shared test utilities in `tests/e2e/lib.sh` | Pass/fail tracking, color output, and retry helpers are currently inline in `e2e-openshell.sh`. Extracting them into `lib.sh` makes them reusable across future test scripts without duplicating code |
| CI pulls Konflux-built images, not rebuild | Images are built by Konflux (the existing build pipeline). The e2e workflow gates on those builds and pulls images by digest, avoiding duplicate builds and ensuring CI tests the exact images that ship. This is expected to cover HYPERSHELL-16 |
| Diagnostic artifacts only on failure | Uploading pod logs, events, and describes on every run wastes GitHub Actions storage. Conditional upload on failure provides debugging information when needed |
| 20-minute CI timeout | Kind cluster creation takes ~2 min, image pulls ~1-2 min, e2e tests ~5-8 min. A 20-minute ceiling provides margin for slow GitHub runners while preventing runaway jobs |
| e2e workflow skips for irrelevant changes | SDK-only or docs-only changes do not affect the e2e path. Skipping avoids CI time, Konflux wait overhead, and a shared-cluster PR namespace that would only run baseline `main` images. The same `should_run` gate applies to `pull_request` and `merge_group`; merge-queue evaluation uses the batch three-dot diff against `merge_group.base_sha`, so a docs-only PR batched with an e2e-relevant change still runs Kind against the speculative merge commit. The `detect-components.sh` infrastructure tracks `api_server`, `control_plane`, `pr_test`, and `e2e` component paths for "should we re-run e2e" decisions; `Deploy OpenShift Environment` uses that same `should_run` gate. `Tests CI Gate` remains the required merge-queue check, so a skipped Kind job does not leave the queue pending. Separately, Konflux image builds only trigger on changes under `components/<name>/` source paths -- the workflow checks the actual diff to distinguish e2e-relevant infrastructure changes (which use baseline images) from source changes (which require Konflux-built images) |
| `make kind-up` accepts image overrides | Passing `IMAGE_TAG=<digest>` or per-component image variables to `make kind-up` allows CI to deploy Konflux-built images directly without a separate load step. Developers can also use this to test specific image versions locally |
| Backward-compatible migration | The refactoring does not change `make kind-up`. `scripts/kind/up.sh` can be migrated to use `kustomize build deploy/kind/` incrementally. The spec defines the target state; the migration path is incremental |
| OpenShift e2e runs use `make openshift-up` as the environment | This spec owns the driver the suite calls. `openshift-development.spec.md` owns bring-up: `make openshift-up`, the `deploy/openshift/` overlay (Routes, Keycloak NetworkPolicy, SCC), namespace rewrite, `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-dev-*` cluster RBAC, and cluster bootstrap. Automated OpenShift pull-request CI and the `e2e-openshell.sh` deprecation window live in `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (HYPERSHELL-240) and are not duplicated here |
| Env vars renamed with `E2E_` prefix | The existing `e2e-openshell.sh` uses `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT`, `PROVISION_TIMEOUT`, `SKIP_CLEANUP`, and `GATEWAY_NAMESPACE`. These are renamed to `E2E_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT`, `E2E_PROVISION_TIMEOUT`, `E2E_SKIP_CLEANUP`, and `E2E_NAMESPACE` to avoid namespace collisions with non-e2e configuration and make the e2e origin of these variables explicit |
| CI uses `make kind-up`, not raw `kind create cluster` | Reuses the same cluster setup path developers use locally. Ensures the CI environment is identical to local development. Avoids a second "create a Kind cluster" implementation that could drift |
| Performance harness reuses the e2e driver interface | The performance test needs the same cross-infrastructure portability as the e2e suite: run on Kind locally, run on any OpenShift cluster for on-demand load tests. Reusing the driver interface means the harness holds no infra-specific code and a new target needs only a new driver file. It also keeps one abstraction to maintain, not two |
| Performance test runs the e2e suite for functional validation | The user requirement is "spin up a ton of gateways, then confirm things still function." The e2e suite already validates the full functional path (provisioning, connectivity, sandbox lifecycle, RBAC, GC) and exits non-zero on any failure. Running it while the perf fleet is up proves the platform still works correctly under load, without duplicating functional assertions in the perf harness |
| Bounded concurrency for scale-up and teardown | Creating hundreds of gateways at once would flood the API server and control plane and would not model a realistic ramp. `E2E_PERF_CONCURRENCY` caps in-flight operations so the client applies steady, controllable load and the harness itself does not become the bottleneck |
| Batched scale-up with per-batch checkpoints | Provisioning all N gateways and validating once at the end hides the scale at which a problem first appears. Adding gateways in batches of `E2E_PERF_BATCH_SIZE` (5--10) and running the e2e suite in perf mode after each batch produces a time series (count vs latency, count vs pass/fail), so a regression is pinned to a scale and the results file is written incrementally. Optional early-stop reports the breaking scale instead of pushing to a guaranteed failure. The suite runs once in long mode at the end as the comprehensive gate |
| Short vs long mode by step tag, not area selector | The quick checks need to touch every area but stay fast. Tagging each step `short` or `long` (rather than selecting whole areas by name) lets the quick modes (`short` and `perf`) run a slice of each portion of the test -- the essential path of every area -- while long mode runs everything. Both modes execute the same assertion code in `e2e-openshell.sh`, so there is one copy of each check and the incremental signal is trustworthy. `E2E_MODE` defaults to `long`, so CI and the final run are unchanged |
| Dedicated canary gateway for the mini test | The perf checkpoint needs a stable target it can reuse across batches without re-paying gateway provisioning and per-gateway OIDC role setup each time. A single canary gateway, provisioned once with its role granted once, is passed via `E2E_GATEWAY_NAME`; perf mode does not delete a supplied gateway, so the canary survives repeated runs. The canary is kept separate from the counted fleet so its own lifecycle is unaffected by fleet churn and it is not double-counted in scale metrics |
| Deterministic gateway names + reuse-or-create | Naming perf gateways `<prefix>-<index>` makes a run idempotent and makes cleanup a simple prefix match. This follows the repo-wide "reconcile, don't create-or-skip" convention and lets a developer re-run the test without accumulating duplicate fleets |
| SLO gating is optional and off by default | A plain run should just report metrics so a developer can explore capacity. Gating (`E2E_PERF_MIN_SUCCESS_RATE`, `E2E_PERF_MAX_PROVISION_P99`) is opt-in so a manual or on-demand run can fail on a regression without forcing thresholds on every local run |
| Performance test is not wired into PR CI | A large-scale provisioning run is too heavy and too slow for the per-PR e2e gate (20-minute ceiling). The performance test is run on demand locally, against any OpenShift cluster, or on a schedule. Keeping it out of the PR path avoids flaky, resource-bound CI failures |
| Terminal-native results: versioned JSON + history files + local report | Because the test is run manually and not in CI, results must digest from a terminal with no CI service. A documented, versioned JSON schema keeps `jq` filters stable across runs; per-run timestamped files build a local history instead of overwriting; a `make e2e-performance-report` target tabulates recent runs so a user can spot a regression. This gives the trend-comparison benefit of a CI benchmark chart without a CI dependency, and leaves the JSON as a clean hook to add `github-action-benchmark` later if the test is ever wired into CI |
| Report depends only on bash | The performance harness writes JSON from bash state and the report reads that schema with bash string helpers. Avoiding `python3` and `jq` means the report runs on a plain machine with no extra install. CSV export is opt-in for users who prefer a spreadsheet |
