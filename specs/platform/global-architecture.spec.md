# Global Architecture

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** Active

## Overview

HyperShell deploys as a global fleet management platform spanning multiple clouds and regions. The architecture uses a **three-tier hub-and-spoke topology**: a Global Hub provides federated identity root, Cloud Hubs run the operational platform (API, control plane, databases), and ManagedClusters host OpenShell Gateway workloads. Every OpenShift cluster in the topology runs the full operator stack (ArgoCD, Vault, Keycloak, CNPG, Prometheus, Grafana) but serves different purposes at each tier.

**Platform delivery is GitOps pull, not hub push.** ArgoCD runs on *every* cluster and reconciles **only itself**: each cluster's ArgoCD pulls its own path from a single central GitOps repository ([`hypershell-gitops`](https://github.com/openshift-online/hypershell-gitops)) and applies the operator stack and HyperShell platform components locally. No cluster stores another cluster's kubeconfig, and no central ArgoCD pushes manifests outward. The GitOps repo is the single source of desired *platform* state; a bootstrap agent seeds each cluster (installs ArgoCD and points it at the cluster's own path), after which the cluster self-reconciles.

> **Two distinct reconciliation planes; do not conflate them.** (1) **Platform GitOps** (this section) deploys the operator stack and HyperShell components; it is *pull*, sourced from Git, per cluster. (2) **Control-plane tenant reconciliation** (see "Control Plane Reconciliation Flow") provisions per-tenant OpenShell Gateway resources at runtime; it is *push* from the Cloud Hub control plane into ManagedClusters, sourced from the Cloud Hub PostgreSQL (the source of truth for tenant desired state) and driven by gRPC watch events. Inverting the GitOps layer to pull does **not** change the control-plane tenant plane.

> **Terminology.** "Gateway" is overloaded, so this document uses fully-qualified
> names. **OpenShell Gateway** is the tenant workload (the pod, its Supervisor,
> and its Sandboxes) that HyperShell provisions. **Gateway API** is the upstream
> Kubernetes API (`gateway.networking.k8s.io`); a **shared Gateway (Gateway API
> resource)** is a `Gateway` object under that API. Cloud load balancers are
> named by provider (AWS NLB/ELB, IBM Cloud VPC LB) rather than a bare
> "gateway". Unqualified "gateway" should be read as OpenShell Gateway.

## Three-Tier Topology

HyperShell uses a three-tier hub-and-spoke architecture. Each tier runs the full operator stack but serves distinct purposes.

### Tier 1: Global Hub

**Purpose**: Identity federation root and cross-cloud observability.

**Components**:
- ArgoCD (self-reconciles this hub's operator stack and config from its own path in the central GitOps repo)
- Keycloak (federates to Red Hat SSO)
- Vault (reserved for future global secrets)
- Grafana (single-pane-of-glass aggregating metrics from all Cloud Hubs)

**Operational Role**: Provides the root of the Keycloak federation chain. Cloud Hubs federate to Global Keycloak, which federates to Red Hat SSO. Future: global monitoring dashboard.

### Tier 2: Cloud Hub

**Purpose**: Primary operational unit. One highly-available instance per cloud provider.

**Components**:
- API Server, Control Plane, Web UI (HA deployment)
- PostgreSQL (via CNPG) - source of truth for Gateway, ManagedCluster resources
- ArgoCD - self-reconciles *this* Cloud Hub's operator stack and HyperShell platform components (API server, control plane, Web UI) by pulling its own path from the central GitOps repo; it does **not** reconcile into ManagedClusters
- Keycloak - federates to Global Keycloak, serves cloud services
- Vault - secrets for cloud hub services (API server, control plane)
- Prometheus - aggregates metrics from this cloud's ManagedClusters
- Grafana - cloud-level dashboards

**Operational Role**: The control plane is the *tenant* reconciliation engine for the fleet. It watches the API server via gRPC and provisions the full set of OpenShell resources into ManagedClusters - not just OpenShell Gateways, but the tenant namespaces, per-tenant PKI, RBAC, ingress objects, CNPG databases, and supporting workloads each gateway depends on. This tenant plane is a runtime *push* sourced from the Cloud Hub PostgreSQL, and is distinct from platform GitOps.

The *platform* layer beneath it is pull-based GitOps: each ManagedCluster's own ArgoCD installs and self-reconciles that cluster's operator stack and baseline config from its own path in the central GitOps repo. So responsibilities split cleanly: a cluster's local ArgoCD owns the cluster's platform (operators, CRDs, cluster-scoped config), and the Cloud Hub control plane owns the tenant resources layered on top. The control plane never installs the operator stack on a ManagedCluster; it assumes the cluster has already self-reconciled it from Git.

### Tier 3: ManagedCluster

**Purpose**: Hosts OpenShell Gateway workloads - the OpenShell Gateway pod, its Supervisor, and the Sandboxes it launches to execute user sessions. Multiple per cloud, deployed close to users (regional).

**Components**:
- ArgoCD - self-reconciles this ManagedCluster's operator stack and baseline config from its own path in the central GitOps repo (pull); the Cloud Hub control plane layers tenant resources on top at runtime
- Keycloak - federates to Cloud Hub Keycloak, holds OIDC clients for OpenShell Gateways on this cluster
- Vault - keystore for gateway secrets
- PostgreSQL (via CNPG) - gateway databases, each in a dedicated ManagedDatabase namespace (`openshell-db-<hash>`)
- Prometheus - local metrics (forwarded to Cloud Hub)
- Gateway namespaces (each contains: OpenShell Gateway pod, Supervisor, Sandboxes, DB credentials Secret, TLS secrets, RBAC)

**Operational Role**: Runs OpenShell Gateway workloads and the Sandboxes they spawn. Users authenticate openshell CLI against Keycloak on the ManagedCluster where their OpenShell Gateway lives.

## Data Flows

### Keycloak Federation Chain

Identity flows from Red Hat SSO down through the tier hierarchy. Each Keycloak federates to the one above it.

```mermaid

    RHSSO -->|Federates| Global

    style Global fill:#3498db
    style Cloud fill:#f39c12
    style MC fill:#2ecc71
    style Clients fill:#95a5a6
```

**Federation Path**: Red Hat SSO → Global Keycloak → Cloud Keycloak → ManagedCluster Keycloak

**Client Registration**: Gateway OIDC clients are registered in the ManagedCluster Keycloak where the gateway runs.

### Gateway Authentication Flow

When a user authenticates their openshell CLI to a gateway:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as openshell CLI
    participant Gateway as Gateway Pod
    participant MCK as ManagedCluster<br/>Keycloak
    participant CloudK as Cloud Hub<br/>Keycloak
    participant GlobalK as Global<br/>Keycloak
    participant RHSSO as Red Hat SSO

    User->>Gateway: Connect to gateway
    Gateway->>MCK: Redirect to OIDC login
    MCK->>User: Show login page
    User->>MCK: Provide credentials
    MCK->>CloudK: Federate authentication
    CloudK->>GlobalK: Federate authentication
    GlobalK->>RHSSO: Federate authentication
    RHSSO-->>GlobalK: Auth response

    MCK->>User: Issue token
    User->>Gateway: Request with token
    Gateway->>MCK: Validate token
    MCK-->>Gateway: Token valid
    Gateway-->>User: Connected
```

### Control Plane Reconciliation Flow

The control plane on the Cloud Hub watches the API server and reconciles gateway resources into ManagedClusters.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as API Client
    participant API as API Server<br/>(Cloud Hub)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL<br/>(CNPG)
    participant CP as Control Plane<br/>(Cloud Hub)
    participant MC as ManagedCluster<br/>K8s API

    User->>API: POST /gateways
    API->>DB: INSERT gateway record
    DB-->>API: Row created
    API->>CP: gRPC Watch event<br/>(Gateway created)
    CP->>MC: kubectl apply<br/>Gateway namespace
    MC-->>CP: Namespace created
    CP->>MC: kubectl apply<br/>Gateway StatefulSet
    MC-->>CP: StatefulSet created
    CP->>MC: kubectl apply<br/>CNPG Database CR<br/>(in openshell-db-<hash> ns)
    MC-->>CP: PostgreSQL database provisioned
    CP->>DB: UPDATE gateway status
    DB-->>CP: Status updated
    CP->>API: gRPC status update
    API-->>User: Gateway deployed
```

**Key Points**:
- PostgreSQL on the Cloud Hub (the HyperShell API server's database) is the source of truth for the **desired state** of HyperShell-managed resources - Gateway, ManagedCluster, and related records. It is not a source of truth for every datum in the system.
- Runtime state owned by each OpenShell Gateway (active Sandboxes, provider credentials, live sessions) lives in that gateway's own database on its ManagedCluster, not in the Cloud Hub PostgreSQL. Where a fact could live in either store, this document names which one owns it.
- Control Plane watches API server via gRPC streams
- Control Plane reconciles *tenant* resources into ManagedClusters via kubeconfig secrets (runtime push; distinct from the platform GitOps pull below)
- Gateway databases run in a dedicated ManagedDatabase namespace (`openshell-db-<hash>`) - a shared CNPG Cluster (`openshell-db`) with a per-gateway logical `Database` CR (`gw-<gateway-id>`) - not in the gateway namespace; only the DB credentials Secret is copied into the gateway namespace

### Platform GitOps Pull Flow

The platform layer (operator stack + HyperShell components) is delivered by each cluster's *own* ArgoCD pulling from the central GitOps repo. There is no central ArgoCD holding remote kubeconfigs and no push from a hub; every cluster reconciles itself.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Eng as Platform Engineer
    participant Repo as Central GitOps Repo<br/>(hypershell-gitops)
    participant Boot as Bootstrap Agent
    participant Argo as Cluster-local ArgoCD
    participant K8s as This cluster's<br/>K8s API

    Note over Eng,Repo: Desired platform state committed once, centrally
    Eng->>Repo: commit manifests under clusters/<this-cluster>/
    Boot->>K8s: install OpenShift GitOps operator (one-time seed)
    Boot->>Argo: oc apply -k clusters/<this-cluster>/gitops (app-of-apps)
    loop continuous self-reconcile
        Argo->>Repo: pull own path (git)
        Repo-->>Argo: desired manifests
        Argo->>K8s: apply locally (operators, CRDs, HyperShell components)
        K8s-->>Argo: live state
        Note over Argo: drift corrected against Git, no external push
    end
```

**Key Points**:
- ArgoCD runs on every cluster and syncs **only that cluster's own path** in the central repo. No cluster holds another cluster's credentials.
- The central GitOps repo is the single source of truth for **platform** desired state (operators, CRDs, HyperShell component manifests). It is *not* the source of truth for tenant gateways; those live in the Cloud Hub PostgreSQL and flow through the control plane (above).
- `bin/bootstrap <cluster>` (in `hypershell-gitops`) performs the one-time seed: install the OpenShift GitOps operator, then `oc apply -k clusters/<cluster>/gitops` (the app-of-apps). Steady-state reconciliation is pull-only.
- A hub outage does not stop a ManagedCluster from reconciling its platform; each cluster is self-sufficient against Git.


## Ingress Architecture

HyperShell utilizes a **dual-ingress strategy** on OpenShift clusters, separating platform management traffic from tenant gateway traffic. This ensures isolation, security, and optimal routing for different protocols.

### 1. Platform Services (Default OpenShift Ingress)

Traffic destined for HyperShell management services (API Server, Web Console, Keycloak) uses the default OpenShift routing tier.

- **Domain:** Standard OpenShift wildcard domain (e.g., `*.apps.rosa...`)
- **Load Balancer:** The cloud's own load balancer fronting the OpenShift router. This is provider-specific: **AWS** uses an internal Network Load Balancer (NLB); **IBM Cloud** (our ROKS clusters) uses a VPC Load Balancer. The same pattern recurs on any cloud we onboard - an Azure Load Balancer equivalent would slot in here - so we describe the role generically and name the concrete instances we run today. (Azure is listed only when we actually deploy there.)
- **Routing Object:** OpenShift `Route` (HAProxy)
- **Mechanism:** The wildcard DNS resolves to the cloud load balancer, which forwards traffic to the OpenShift router pods. HAProxy uses hostname-based routing to direct traffic to the correct service.

### 2. Tenant Gateways (Kubernetes Gateway API)

Traffic destined for the actual managed gRPC gateways bypasses the default OpenShift router and uses a dedicated ingress path managed by the Kubernetes Gateway API (backed by Istio).

- **Domain:** Dedicated base domain (e.g., `*.openshell.stage.example.com`)
- **Load Balancer:** Dedicated AWS Classic ELB (provisioned by the Gateway API controller)
- **Routing Object:** `GRPCRoute` attached to a central `Gateway`
- **Mechanism:** A single shared Gateway (Gateway API resource) `openshell-grpc-gateway` in the `openshift-ingress` namespace terminates TLS using a wildcard certificate. When the control plane provisions a new OpenShell Gateway in a tenant namespace, it creates a `GRPCRoute` that automatically attaches to this shared Gateway (Gateway API resource). External DNS (e.g., Route53) manages the CNAME mapping the wildcard domain to the AWS ELB address.

This architecture allows the control plane to dynamically route traffic for new OpenShell Gateways without needing to provision individual load balancers or DNS records per tenant.

### Tenant gateway ingress is environment-adaptive (two modes)

Not every cluster can run the Gateway API. HyperShell is composable per
environment (see the deploy overlays), so the tenant-gateway ingress path is a
**selectable mode**, chosen by configuration, not by forking behavior:

| Mode | Routing object | When to use | Externally provisioned by |
|------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **`gateway-api`** (reference) | `GRPCRoute` → shared `Gateway` | Gateway API GA and functional (AWS/ROSA, OCP ≥ 4.19 with working CIO Istio) | Shared `Gateway` + wildcard cert + Route53 CNAME |
| **`route`** | OpenShift `Route` (`passthrough`) | Gateway API absent or non-functional (IBM Cloud ROKS - HyperShift-hosted, cannot pull OSSM images, IDMS owned by the HostedCluster) | Cluster's default router (HAProxy) on the platform wildcard |

Both modes converge on the **same** tenant workload, which presents two server
certificates by SNI (the dual-certificate model from
[NVIDIA/OpenShell#2468](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/pull/2468)):

1. **Internal cert** - the per-tenant self-signed CA (`openshell-ca` →
   `openshell-server-tls`) covering the cluster-local Service names on the
   supervisor↔gateway path. Supervisors trust **only** this per-tenant chart CA
   (never WebPKI); that is what blocks a malicious sandbox image from MITM-ing
   the supervisor connection. This internal CA is always present.
2. **External cert** - a certificate signed by a **trusted CA**, minted by an
   **operator-configured** cert-manager `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` (for example
   ACME / Let's Encrypt), covering the **public SANs**
   (`gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>`) used by the `openshell` CLI and the OpenShift
   `Route`. Because it chains to a publicly trusted root, the CLI needs no custom
   CA bundle.

Client **identity** is established by OIDC (Keycloak bearer tokens), never client
certificates - HyperShell does not require or support client mTLS. TLS is
server-side transport encryption only; callers are authenticated by OIDC.

In `route` mode the `Route` is `passthrough`: the router forwards the encrypted
connection SNI-routed end-to-end and the gateway pod serves the **external
trusted cert** on the public SAN. No shared `Gateway`, wildcard certificate, or
GRPCRoute machinery is required - only the operator-configured `Issuer` for the
external cert. In `gateway-api` mode the shared `Gateway` terminates the client's
TLS and re-encrypts to the backend, validated by a `BackendTLSPolicy`.

> **Current limitation (tracked).** The external trusted cert requires an
> ACME-solvable domain the operator controls. On a Cloud Hub that only exposes
> the provider's shared ingress wildcard it does not own (for example IBM ROKS'
> `*.containers.appdomain.cloud`), a publicly trusted cert is not yet issuable,
> so `route` mode there still serves the internal `openshell-ca` and the CLI must
> pin that CA. Wiring the operator-configured external `Issuer`
> (`serverIssuerRef` / `external_server_names`, per OpenShell#2468) end-to-end is
> tracked follow-up work.

The mode is set by the control-plane env var `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE`
(`gateway-api` | `route` | `none`). When unset it is auto-detected from cluster
capabilities (`gateway-api` if the Gateway API is present, else `route` on
OpenShift). Because some platforms ship the Gateway API CRDs but cannot run it
(ROKS), those environments set `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE=route` explicitly via their
kustomize overlay (`deploy/ibm`). See "Requirement: Control Plane Ingress Mode".

### Tenant Gateway Ingress - Reference Implementation (verified on AWS)

> The following was captured live from the `hypershell-stage` deployment on the
> ROSA cluster `hcmais01ue1` (2026-08-15). It is the source-of-truth
> implementation that other clouds (IBM Cloud) must reach parity with. Values
> such as ELB hostnames and tenant hashes are environment-specific.

```

The Gateway API implementation is **OpenShift's built-in support**, not a manual
Istio install. The Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO) installs and manages `istiod`
(Sail operator) and reconciles the `openshift-default` GatewayClass.

- **GatewayClass:** `openshift-default`
- **Controller:** `openshift.io/gateway-controller/v1` ("Handled by Istio controller"; `istiod v1.28.5` installed by CIO)
- **Gateway → LoadBalancer:** creating the `Gateway` causes the operator to create an Istio ingress `Deployment` + `Service` (`type: LoadBalancer`); the cloud CCM then provisions the external LB (AWS Classic ELB observed: `a1a663034da9843c3944de9cbdaceb98-536422505.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

#### Manifest 1 - Shared Gateway (one per cluster, in `openshift-ingress`)

Created/owned by the control plane (`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: hypershell-control-plane`).

            name: wildcard-openshell-stage-example-tls
```

#### Manifest 2 - Per-tenant GRPCRoute (control plane creates one per gateway)

Lives in the tenant namespace (`openshell-<tenant-hash>`), attaches cross-namespace to the shared Gateway's `grpc` listener.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GRPCRoute
metadata:
  name: openshell-gateway

          name: openshell-gateway
          port: 8080
          weight: 1
```

#### Manifest 3 - Wildcard TLS certificate (cert-manager, in `openshift-ingress`)

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: wildcard-openshell-stage-example
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  secretName: wildcard-openshell-stage-example-tls
  dnsNames:
    - "*.openshell.stage.example.com"
  issuerRef:
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: letsencrypt-examplecom-dns
```

#### Manifest 4 - ClusterIssuer (ACME / Let's Encrypt, DNS-01 via Route53)

The `example.com` zone is centrally hosted in AWS Route53, so the DNS-01 solver
is Route53 **regardless of which cloud the cluster runs in**. This is the key that
lets an IBM Cloud cluster obtain a `*.example.com` certificate without any
IBM-native DNS integration.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-examplecom-dns
spec:
  acme:
    solvers:
      - selector:
          dnsZones: ["example.com"]
        dns01:
          route53:
            region: global
            hostedZoneID: Z05758033SZ8IESGUOY8E
            accessKeyIDSecretRef:
              name: certmgr-<cluster>-example-com-sa
              key: aws_access_key_id
            secretAccessKeySecretRef:
              name: certmgr-<cluster>-example-com-sa
              key: aws_secret_access_key
```

#### DNS record

There is **no `external-dns` controller** on the AWS cluster; the Gateway reports
`DNS management policy is set to Unmanaged`. The wildcard record is a static
Route53 entry:

```
*.openshell.stage.example.com.  CNAME  <cloud-LB-hostname>
```

resolving to the Gateway's provisioned LB. It must be created (once per cluster)
after the LB hostname is known.

### IBM Cloud Cloud Hub - Route ingress mode (verified 2026-08-15)

IBM Cloud ROKS does **not** run the Gateway API, so the IBM Cloud Hub uses the
**`route` ingress mode** (see "environment-adaptive" above) rather than reaching
`gateway-api` parity. This is a deliberate, first-class configuration, not a
degraded fallback.

**Why Gateway API is unavailable on ROKS (exhaustively verified on `hysh-ibm-01`,
OCP 4.21.27, 2026-08-15):** the CRDs and feature gates are present, and creating
the `openshift-default` GatewayClass makes the CIO deploy `istiod`, but it
`ImagePullBackOff`s - the OSSM images (`registry.redhat.io/openshift-service-mesh/
istio-pilot-rhel9`, `istio-proxyv2-rhel9`) are not stocked in IBM's node mirror
and worker egress to `registry.redhat.io` is blocked. ROKS is **HyperShift-hosted**:
a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` named `mirror` denies creating
`ImageDigestMirrorSet`/`ImageTagMirrorSet` in the guest (node `registries.conf`
is owned by the HostedCluster), and CIO reverts any Deployment image patch within
~45s. OperatorHub is also broken (catalog pods `ImagePullBackOff`), so OLM install
of Sail/OSSM is unavailable too. The **only** supported way to make Gateway API
work on ROKS is an IBM-side change to the HostedCluster (mirror/allowlist), which
is out of our control. See [`ibm-cluster`](../../skills/deploy/ibm-cluster/SKILL.md).

Steps (Route mode on ROKS):

1. **Provision a ROKS cluster on OCP ≥ 4.19** (Cloud Hub `hysh-ibm-01`, OCP
   4.21.27). Registry storage must be a **ReadWriteOnce** PVC (IBM VPC block is
   RWO-only; the operator's default RWM PVC fails `VolumeCapabilitiesNotSupported`).
2. **Deploy the control plane with the IBM overlay** (`deploy/ibm`), which sets
   `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE=route` and `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` to the cluster's
   ingress subdomain (IBM's free `*.<ingress-subdomain>.containers.appdomain.cloud`
   wildcard). Route mode removes only the *ingress-layer* PKI - no wildcard
   certificate, cert-manager `ClusterIssuer`, Route53, or external DNS. It does
   **not** remove cert-manager itself: cert-manager (namespaced `Issuer` +
   per-tenant `Certificate`s minting the `openshell-ca` chain for the pod's own
   server TLS) remains a **hard prerequisite in every ingress mode**
   (`reconcileCertManagerResources`; reconcile fails closed without it). On ROKS,
   OperatorHub is broken, so cert-manager is installed by mirroring its images into
   the internal registry (see [`ibm-cluster`](../../skills/deploy/ibm-cluster/SKILL.md)).
3. **Provision a test tenant gateway** with `route.enabled=true`. The control
   plane creates an OpenShift `Route` (`passthrough`) `openshell-gateway` in the
   tenant namespace with host `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>`, backed by
   `Service openshell-gateway:8080`, plus the `openshell-gateway-allow-router`
   NetworkPolicy, and publishes `grpcs://<host>:443` as the gateway's route address.
   The tenant workload images (gateway, supervisor, gateway database) must be
   **node-reachable**; on ROKS they are mirrored into the internal registry and
   referenced by its in-cluster service address (see `ibm-cluster` Step 5).
4. **Verify:** the `Route` reports `Admitted=True`; its SANs include
   `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>` (the control plane injects the derived ingress
   hostname into the certificate SANs automatically - operators do not set it by
   hand). The **target** state (per
   [NVIDIA/OpenShell#2468](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/pull/2468)) is that
   the passthrough serves the **external trusted cert** from an
   operator-configured `Issuer`, so the CLI connects with no custom CA. On ROKS
   today that cert is not issuable on IBM's shared `*.containers.appdomain.cloud`
   wildcard (the operator does not control the zone, so ACME cannot solve it), so
   the passthrough currently chains to the per-tenant self-signed `openshell-ca`
   and a client must pin that CA to connect over `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>:443`.
   Wiring the external `Issuer` end-to-end is tracked follow-up work.

To later switch a cloud to `gateway-api` mode (e.g. if IBM fixes HostedCluster
mirroring), unset `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE` (or set it to `gateway-api`) and complete
the shared-Gateway bootstrap; the control plane then emits `GRPCRoute`s and cleans
up the Routes. The AWS reference (`gateway-api` mode) is unchanged.

### Requirements

#### Requirement: Tenant Gateway Ingress via Gateway API (`gateway-api` mode)

In `gateway-api` mode, tenant gateway traffic SHALL be routed through the
Kubernetes Gateway API using a single shared `Gateway` (`openshell-grpc-gateway`)
in the `openshift-ingress` namespace. In this mode tenant gateways SHALL NOT use
OpenShift `Route` objects for data-plane gRPC traffic.

##### Scenario: Gateway provisioning creates a GRPCRoute

- GIVEN a cluster in `gateway-api` mode with the `openshift-default` GatewayClass and the shared `openshell-grpc-gateway`
- WHEN the control plane provisions a new tenant gateway
- THEN it SHALL create a `GRPCRoute` in the tenant namespace with a `parentRef` to `openshell-grpc-gateway` (`sectionName: grpc`)
- AND the route hostname SHALL be `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>` under the shared listener's wildcard
- AND it SHALL NOT create an OpenShift `Route` for gRPC data-plane traffic

#### Requirement: Tenant Gateway Ingress via OpenShift Route (`route` mode)

In `route` mode, tenant gateway traffic SHALL be exposed through an OpenShift
`Route`. The TLS termination of that `Route` SHALL be selectable via the
control-plane env var `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION` (`passthrough` | `reencrypt`),
defaulting to `passthrough`. In this mode the control plane SHALL NOT require a
shared `Gateway`, a wildcard certificate, or external DNS integration.

- **`passthrough`** (default): the `Route` uses `tls.termination: passthrough`
  with `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: None`, so the gateway pod's own server TLS
  is preserved end-to-end and the router forwards the raw TLS stream. This is the
  ROKS path, where the operator does not control the ingress zone and a publicly
  trusted edge certificate is not issuable.
- **`reencrypt`**: the `Route` uses `tls.termination: reencrypt` with
  `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect`, so the router terminates the client's
  TLS with its own default publicly trusted `*.apps` wildcard certificate and
  re-encrypts to the gateway pod. The `Route` SHALL carry no edge `certificate`
  or `key` (the router serves its default wildcard) and SHALL set
  `tls.destinationCACertificate` to the `ca.crt` of the per-namespace
  `openshell-server-tls` secret so the router validates the backend. This is the
  ROSA trusted-TLS path: the client connects with no custom CA bundle.

Because the gateway server config carries no `client_ca_path`, the openshell
server accepts the connection the router presents without a client certificate;
OIDC remains the sole client authentication. gRPC over a `reencrypt` `Route`
therefore requires the router to negotiate HTTP/2 to the backend, so the cluster
`IngressController` SHALL have HTTP/2 enabled (see § Route Reencrypt Prerequisites).

##### Scenario: Gateway provisioning creates a passthrough Route

- GIVEN a cluster in `route` mode (`GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE=route`) with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION` unset or `passthrough`
- WHEN the control plane provisions a new tenant gateway with ingress enabled
- THEN it SHALL create a `Route` `openshell-gateway` in the tenant namespace with `spec.tls.termination: passthrough`, `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: None`, and `port.targetPort: grpc` to `Service openshell-gateway`
- AND the route hostname SHALL be `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>` (or the gateway's explicit `route.host`)
- AND it SHALL publish `grpcs://<host>:443` as the gateway's route address
- AND it SHALL NOT create a `GRPCRoute`, shared `Gateway`, or `BackendTLSPolicy`

##### Scenario: Gateway provisioning creates a reencrypt Route

- GIVEN a cluster in `route` mode with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt` and a per-namespace `openshell-server-tls` secret carrying `ca.crt`
- WHEN the control plane provisions a new tenant gateway with ingress enabled
- THEN it SHALL create a `Route` `openshell-gateway` with `spec.tls.termination: reencrypt` and `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect`
- AND it SHALL set `spec.tls.destinationCACertificate` to the `ca.crt` of `openshell-server-tls`
- AND it SHALL NOT set `spec.tls.certificate` or `spec.tls.key` (the router serves its default trusted wildcard)

##### Scenario: Reencrypt without the server CA fails closed

- GIVEN a cluster in `route` mode with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt` where the `openshell-server-tls` secret has no `ca.crt` yet
- WHEN the control plane reconciles the tenant gateway
- THEN it SHALL return an error and SHALL NOT create the `Route` (a reencrypt `Route` without a `destinationCACertificate` would let the router skip backend validation)

##### Scenario: Disabling ingress removes the mode's routing objects

- GIVEN a provisioned tenant gateway with a routing object for the active mode
- WHEN ingress is disabled (`route.enabled=false`) or the gateway is deleted
- THEN the control plane SHALL delete the tenant's `Route` (route mode) or `GRPCRoute`/`BackendTLSPolicy` (gateway-api mode) and the `openshell-gateway-allow-router` NetworkPolicy
- AND it SHALL clear the gateway's route address

#### Requirement: Cloud-Agnostic Gateway Manifests

The `Gateway`, `GRPCRoute`, `Certificate`, and `ClusterIssuer` manifests SHALL be
identical across clouds except for the per-environment base domain and TLS secret
name. The external load balancer SHALL be provisioned automatically by the cloud's
CCM from the operator-created `Service type: LoadBalancer`; no per-cloud load
balancer manifest SHALL be required.

##### Scenario: IBM Cloud provisions a VPC LB from the same Gateway

- GIVEN the shared `Gateway` manifest applied on a ROKS VPC Gen2 cluster
- WHEN the Cluster Ingress Operator reconciles it
- THEN IBM Cloud CCM SHALL provision a VPC Load Balancer (`*.lb.appdomain.cloud`)
- AND the `Gateway` status SHALL report `Programmed=True` with the LB hostname as its address

#### Requirement: Wildcard TLS via Central Route53 DNS-01

Wildcard certificates for the `example.com` base domain SHALL be issued by
cert-manager using the ACME DNS-01 challenge against the central Route53
`example.com` hosted zone, independent of the cluster's cloud provider.

#### Requirement: Control Plane Ingress Mode

The control plane's ingress mode (`gateway-api` vs `route`) SHALL be
configuration-driven, not cloud-hardcoded, so the same binary produces `GRPCRoute`s
or OpenShift `Route`s depending only on the selected mode. The mode SHALL be
selectable via the `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE` env var (`gateway-api` | `route` |
`none`), overridable per environment through a kustomize overlay
(`deploy/openshift` defaults to `gateway-api`; `deploy/ibm` sets `route`).

##### Scenario: Explicit mode overrides auto-detection

- GIVEN a cluster where the Gateway API CRDs are present but non-functional (ROKS)
- WHEN `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE=route` is set
- THEN the control plane SHALL provision OpenShift `Route`s and SHALL NOT attempt Gateway API resources

##### Scenario: Auto-detection when no mode is set

- GIVEN `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE` is unset
- WHEN the control plane reconciles a gateway
- THEN it SHALL select `gateway-api` if the Gateway API is detected, otherwise `route` on OpenShift, otherwise skip managed ingress

#### Requirement: Route Reencrypt Prerequisites

The `reencrypt` Route termination (`GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt`) SHALL be
configuration-driven and SHALL default off (`passthrough`), so existing `route`-mode
clusters (ROKS) keep their end-to-end passthrough behavior with no change. Selecting
`reencrypt` SHALL NOT introduce new RBAC: the control plane already reads the
per-namespace `openshell-server-tls` secret for the Gateway API `BackendTLSPolicy`
path, and the reencrypt Route reuses that same read.

Because the router re-encrypts to the gateway pod and the gateway serves gRPC (HTTP/2
via ALPN `h2`), the cluster `IngressController` SHALL have HTTP/2 enabled for the
router to negotiate HTTP/2 to the backend. Operators enabling `reencrypt` SHALL set
`spec.httpEmptyRequestsPolicy`/HTTP/2 on the default `IngressController` (for example
`oc annotate ingresscontroller/default -n openshift-ingress-operator ingress.operator.openshift.io/default-enable-http2=true`)
before switching tenants to `reencrypt`; without it, gRPC calls over the Route fail
to negotiate HTTP/2.

Enabling HTTP/2 on the `IngressController` is necessary but NOT sufficient for
client-facing gRPC: OpenShift advertises ALPN `h2` to external clients only on
edge/reencrypt Routes that carry their own `spec.tls.certificate`. A `reencrypt`
Route relying on the router's shared default `*.apps` wildcard is deliberately
denied `h2` (to prevent client connection coalescing across Routes sharing one
certificate), so it fixes `UnknownIssuer` but still cannot serve gRPC. Serving
client HTTP/2 additionally requires a per-gateway Route certificate (see
§ Per-Gateway Route Certificate for Client-Facing HTTP/2).

##### Scenario: Termination defaults to passthrough on existing clusters

- GIVEN a `route`-mode cluster where `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION` is unset
- WHEN the control plane provisions a tenant gateway
- THEN it SHALL create a `passthrough` Route, preserving the prior ROKS behavior

##### Scenario: Reencrypt requires no additional RBAC

- GIVEN a `route`-mode cluster switched to `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt`
- WHEN the control plane reads `ca.crt` from the `openshell-server-tls` secret to populate `destinationCACertificate`
- THEN it SHALL use the existing secret-read permission (the same one the `BackendTLSPolicy` path uses) and SHALL NOT require a new Role or ClusterRole rule

#### Requirement: Per-Gateway Route Certificate for Client-Facing HTTP/2

To serve gRPC to external clients over a `reencrypt` Route, the control plane
SHALL support a `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TLS_ISSUER` env var naming a cert-manager
`ClusterIssuer`. When set together with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt`, the
control plane SHALL annotate the tenant `openshell-gateway` Route with
`cert-manager.io/issuer-name: <issuer>` and `cert-manager.io/issuer-kind:
ClusterIssuer`, delegating per-gateway certificate issuance and injection into
`spec.tls.{certificate,key}` to the cert-manager openshift-routes controller. The
issued certificate covers the gateway's Route host (`gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>`),
which makes the router advertise ALPN `h2` to clients. `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TLS_ISSUER`
SHALL default off; when unset the Route keeps the shared default wildcard (trusted
TLS, but no client-facing HTTP/2). It SHALL be ignored unless termination is
`reencrypt` (a passthrough Route has no router-terminated edge certificate).

Because the control plane reconciles the Route with a full replace, it SHALL
preserve any `spec.tls.certificate`/`spec.tls.key` already injected by the
openshift-routes controller across reconciles. The two controllers co-own the
Route - the control plane owns `termination` and `destinationCACertificate`, the
openshift-routes controller owns the edge certificate - and neither SHALL clobber
the other's fields (which would otherwise flap ALPN `h2`, and hence gRPC, on every
reconcile). This introduces no new control-plane RBAC: issuance is performed by
the openshift-routes controller, not the control plane.

##### Scenario: Issuer set annotates the Route for cert-manager

- GIVEN a `route`-mode cluster with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION=reencrypt` and `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TLS_ISSUER=letsencrypt-http01`
- WHEN the control plane provisions a tenant gateway
- THEN the `openshell-gateway` Route SHALL carry annotations `cert-manager.io/issuer-name: letsencrypt-http01` and `cert-manager.io/issuer-kind: ClusterIssuer`
- AND the control plane SHALL still own `spec.tls.termination: reencrypt` and `destinationCACertificate`

##### Scenario: Issuer unset keeps the shared wildcard

- GIVEN a `route`-mode reencrypt cluster where `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TLS_ISSUER` is unset
- WHEN the control plane provisions a tenant gateway
- THEN the Route SHALL carry no `cert-manager.io/*` annotation and SHALL rely on the router's default `*.apps` wildcard (trusted TLS, but the router will not advertise ALPN `h2` to clients)

##### Scenario: Reconcile preserves an injected edge certificate

- GIVEN a `reencrypt` Route whose `spec.tls.certificate`/`key` were injected by the openshift-routes controller
- WHEN the control plane reconciles the tenant gateway again
- THEN it SHALL carry the injected `certificate` and `key` forward unchanged
- AND it SHALL continue to own `termination` and `destinationCACertificate`

##### Scenario: Issuer is ignored without reencrypt

- GIVEN a `route`-mode cluster with `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TLS_ISSUER` set but `GATEWAY_ROUTE_TERMINATION` unset or `passthrough`
- WHEN the control plane provisions a tenant gateway
- THEN the Route SHALL NOT carry the cert-manager annotations

#### Requirement: cert-manager Is a Mode-Independent Prerequisite

Every tenant gateway SHALL depend on cert-manager for its per-tenant PKI: a
namespaced `Issuer` (`openshell-ca`) and `Certificate`s minting the gateway's own
server TLS and CA. This is independent of the ingress mode - `route`
mode removes only the ingress-layer wildcard certificate/`ClusterIssuer`/Route53,
not the pod-TLS layer. The control plane SHALL fail closed when cert-manager is
absent.

##### Scenario: Reconcile blocks without cert-manager

- GIVEN a cluster without cert-manager installed (any ingress mode)
- WHEN the control plane reconciles a tenant gateway
- THEN it SHALL return an error and SHALL NOT deploy the gateway workload

#### Requirement: Public Ingress Uses a Trusted External Certificate

Per [NVIDIA/OpenShell#2468](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/pull/2468), the
certificate served on the **public** ingress hostname (`gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>`)
SHALL chain to a **publicly trusted CA**, minted by an **operator-configured**
cert-manager `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` (for example ACME / Let's Encrypt) whose
DNS-01/HTTP-01 challenge the operator can solve for a zone it controls. The
gateway pod SHALL present this external cert (via `external_cert_path` /
`external_key_path` / `external_server_names`, selected by SNI) so the `openshell`
CLI connects with **no custom CA bundle**. This is independent of the per-tenant
self-signed `openshell-ca`, which is retained for the supervisor↔gateway path
(supervisors trust only the chart CA, blocking MITM from a malicious sandbox
image). Where the operator does not control the ingress zone (for example IBM
ROKS' shared `*.containers.appdomain.cloud` wildcard), no publicly trusted cert is
issuable; the gateway SHALL fall back to serving the internal `openshell-ca` and
the CLI SHALL pin it. Wiring the external `Issuer` (`serverIssuerRef` /
`external_server_names`) end-to-end is tracked follow-up work.

##### Scenario: CLI connects to a trusted public endpoint without a custom CA

- GIVEN an operator-configured external `Issuer` for a zone the operator controls
- AND a tenant gateway provisioned with a public SAN under that zone
- WHEN the `openshell` CLI connects to `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>:443`
- THEN the served certificate SHALL chain to a publicly trusted root
- AND the CLI SHALL verify it using only the system trust store

#### Requirement: Gateway Server Certificate Covers the Ingress Hostname

Because both ingress modes carry the gateway pod's TLS through unmodified (Route
passthrough / Gateway API `BackendTLSPolicy`), the gateway server certificate
SHALL list the external ingress hostname (`gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>`, or an
explicit `route.host`) as a SAN. The control plane derives that hostname, so it
SHALL inject it into the certificate SANs itself, before cert-manager mints the
certificate - operators SHALL NOT be required to set `external_dns`/
`server_dns_names` by hand for the ingress hostname to be covered.

##### Scenario: Derived hostname appears in the served certificate

- GIVEN a tenant gateway with ingress enabled and `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` set
- WHEN the control plane provisions it
- THEN the certificate served over the ingress hostname SHALL include
  `gw-<tenant>.<base-domain>` as a SAN, with hostname verification enabled
- AND that certificate SHALL chain to the operator-configured external trusted CA
  where one is available for the zone, otherwise to the per-tenant `openshell-ca`
  (which the CLI must then pin)

#### Requirement: Image References Support an In-Cluster Registry

Gateway image references (gateway, supervisor) SHALL accept a registry host that
carries an explicit port, as standard Docker references permit
(`host[:port]/path[:tag]`), so images mirrored into the cluster-internal registry
(`image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/...`) - the only node-reachable
source on ROKS - pass validation. The per-tenant database image SHALL be
overridable via `HYPERSHELL_DATABASE_IMAGE` for the same reason, and the gateway's
`supervisor_image` SHALL be settable through the API (`PATCH`) so sandboxes pull
from a node-reachable registry.

#### Requirement: Agent Sandbox CRD Is a Sandbox Prerequisite

Tenant sandbox operations (`openshell sandbox list/create`) depend on the Agent
Sandbox CRD + controller (`sandboxes.agents.x-k8s.io`, the upstream
`kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox` project) being installed cluster-wide. The control
plane SHALL provision only the per-tenant sandbox RBAC (SA, Role/RoleBinding
against `agents.x-k8s.io`, and on OpenShift the privileged-SCC binding); it SHALL
NOT install the CRD/controller, which is a cluster prerequisite on par with
cert-manager. The gateway's Kubernetes compute driver watches this CRD; when it is
absent the sandbox RPCs surface as gRPC `Unimplemented` and the driver logs `no
supported Agent Sandbox API version is available`. The version installed SHALL
serve the API version the gateway requires (`v1beta1` for gateway 0.0.113; upstream
`v0.5.x`).

#### Requirement: Sandbox Base Image Supports an In-Cluster Registry

The base image tenant sandbox pods launch from (the gateway `default_image`) SHALL
be overridable via `GATEWAY_SANDBOX_IMAGE` (control-plane env), so that on clusters
whose nodes cannot reach `ghcr.io` (e.g. ROKS) it can be pointed at a mirror in the
cluster-internal registry. This mirrors the `HYPERSHELL_DATABASE_IMAGE` override for
the gateway database.

##### Scenario: Sandbox launch on a cluster without public egress

- GIVEN a cluster whose worker nodes cannot pull from `ghcr.io` or `registry.k8s.io`
- AND the Agent Sandbox CRD + controller and the sandbox base image have been mirrored into the internal registry
- WHEN `GATEWAY_SANDBOX_IMAGE` points the gateway `default_image` at the mirrored base image
- THEN a created Sandbox's pod SHALL pull the base image from the internal registry and reach Running
- AND the gateway compute driver SHALL watch `agents.x-k8s.io` without `Unimplemented` errors

### Open Questions (for implementer review)

1. **[RESOLVED] ROKS Gateway API availability.** Verified on 2026-08-15 across two clusters: on the old 4.17 cluster the CRDs were absent; on the new `hysh-ibm-01` (4.21.27) the CRDs and feature gates are present but the Gateway API is **non-functional** (CIO `istiod` cannot pull OSSM images; IDMS denied by the HostedCluster; CIO reverts patches; OperatorHub broken). **Decision:** the IBM Cloud Hub uses the `route` ingress mode (`deploy/ibm`, `GATEWAY_INGRESS_MODE=route`), not Gateway API. See "IBM Cloud Cloud Hub - Route ingress mode".
2. **IBM base domain.** What exact subdomain - e.g. `openshell.ibm-stage.example.com`?
   Confirm it is delegated within the Route53 `example.com` zone.
3. **[RESOLVED - BUG] Control-plane config surface.** Verified on 2026-08-15: The Go code reads `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN` and `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_CLASS`. However, it **completely ignores** the gateway name and namespace config. `internal/gateway/reconciler.go` currently hardcodes the `GRPCRoute` `parentRefs` to `name: openshell-gateway` inside the tenant's own namespace. This is a severe bug that provisions one Load Balancer per tenant. This code must be patched to respect `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAME` and `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` to use the shared ingress gateway.
4. **DNS record creation.** Reproduce the AWS pattern (static Route53 wildcard
   CNAME, no external-dns), or introduce `external-dns` to automate it on IBM?
5. **Route53 credentials on IBM.** Provision the `certmgr-<cluster>-example-com-sa`
   secret (IAM user scoped to the `example.com` zone) on the IBM cluster.
6. **[RESOLVED] VPC LB scope.** Verified on 2026-08-15: The default OpenShift router on this IBM cluster uses a public VPC Load Balancer (`service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-ip-type: public`). We will match this public exposure for the Gateway API VPC LB.
7. **Legacy Route-based gateways.** The AWS cluster still has older tenants on
   `Route`/`passthrough` under `*.apps.rosa...`. Is a migration of existing tenants
   in scope, or parity for new tenants only?

## Tooling Stack

| Component | Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Database operator | CNPG (CloudNativePG) | PostgreSQL lifecycle (replaces per-gateway cloud databases) |
| GitOps | ArgoCD (on every cluster) | Each cluster self-reconciles its own platform state by pulling its path from the central GitOps repo (pull model) |
| Secret management | Vault | Stores and rotates secrets with cloud-native drivers |
| Identity | Keycloak | OIDC authentication for gateways and console |
| Cluster provisioning | Terraform | VPC, subnet, and cluster provisioning |
| Installer | Tekton pipelines | Reproducible, deterministic deployment pipelines |

## Database Strategy: CNPG

CloudNativePG replaces per-gateway cloud-managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL). CNPG runs PostgreSQL clusters as Kubernetes-native resources with automated failover, backup, and recovery.

### Requirements

#### Requirement: CNPG Operator Deployment

The CNPG operator SHALL be deployed on the hub cluster. Each ManagedDatabase SHALL be provisioned as a CNPG Cluster resource in its own dedicated namespace (`openshell-db-<hash>`), and gateway databases SHALL be provisioned as logical CNPG `Database` resources inside that ManagedDatabase namespace - not in the gateway namespace.

##### Scenario: Gateway Database Provisioning via CNPG

- GIVEN a Gateway resource with a `database_id` referencing a ManagedDatabase
- WHEN the ManagedDatabase specifies `provider: cnpg`
- THEN the controller SHALL ensure a CNPG Cluster (`openshell-db`) exists in the ManagedDatabase namespace (`openshell-db-<hash>`)
- AND the controller SHALL create a per-gateway logical `Database` and `DatabaseRole` (`gw-<gateway-id>`) inside that ManagedDatabase namespace
- AND the controller SHALL copy the resulting `openshell-gateway-db-credentials` Secret into the gateway namespace

#### Requirement: Database Lifecycle Independence

ManagedDatabase resources SHALL have an independent lifecycle from Gateways. A single CNPG Cluster in a ManagedDatabase namespace MAY serve multiple gateways, each via its own logical `Database` CR.

## Namespace Strategy

Gateway and its sandboxes coexist in the same namespace as a scalable unit. Each gateway deployment gets its own namespace containing its workloads, config, and security resources. Its database lives in a separate ManagedDatabase namespace (see below).

- **Security**: NetworkPolicies, ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings

**Gateway Database (separate namespace)**: Provisioned by the ManagedDatabase controller in `openshell-db-<hash>` - a shared CNPG `Cluster` (`openshell-db`) plus a per-gateway logical `Database`/`DatabaseRole` (`gw-<gateway-id>`). See the [naming & multi-tenancy standard](../standards/platform/naming-multitenancy.spec.md).

This namespace-per-gateway strategy provides:
- Isolation boundary for RBAC and network policies
- Resource quotas per gateway
- Self-contained workload lifecycle (delete namespace = delete gateway workload; the logical `Database` is reclaimed independently)
- A shared CNPG instance per ManagedDatabase, reducing the Postgres footprint across gateways

## Installer Pipeline

Tekton pipelines provide a reproducible installer for HyperShell deployments. The pipeline replaces manual bash scripts with deterministic, auditable steps.

### Requirements

#### Requirement: Deterministic Installation

HyperShell installation SHALL be performed via Tekton pipelines that execute idempotent steps. Manual `oc apply` or `kubectl` scripts SHALL NOT be the primary installation method in production.

##### Scenario: Fresh Cluster Installation

- GIVEN a bare OpenShift cluster with Tekton installed
- WHEN the HyperShell installer pipeline runs
- THEN it SHALL provision: CNPG operator, cert-manager, API server, controller, PostgreSQL, ArgoCD, Vault, Keycloak
- AND the installation SHALL be idempotent (safe to re-run)

#### Requirement: Cattle Not Pets

Infrastructure SHALL be treated as disposable. Any cluster can be torn down and rebuilt from the pipeline without manual intervention or state recovery.

## Monitoring Architecture

Prometheus runs on every cluster. Metrics flow from ManagedClusters → Cloud Hub → Global Hub.

### Requirements

#### Requirement: Managed Cluster Metrics

Every managed cluster SHALL run a Prometheus instance that scrapes gateway and node metrics. Metrics SHALL be forwarded to the regional or global hub.

#### Requirement: Hub Dashboards

The hub cluster SHALL run Grafana with dashboards for fleet-wide gateway health, resource utilization, and provisioning status across all managed clusters.

## Managed Cluster Flexibility

Managed clusters are not restricted to OpenShift. Standard Kubernetes distributions (EKS, GKE, vanilla K8s) are valid targets. The controller auto-detects cluster capabilities:

| Capability | Detection | Behavior when absent |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| OpenShift Routes | `route.openshift.io` API group | Use Gateway API or NodePort |
| cert-manager | `cert-manager.io` API group | Block deployment (required) |
| Gateway API | `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` GRPCRoute | Skip GRPCRoute/BackendTLSPolicy |
| Agent Sandbox CRD | `agents.x-k8s.io` | Sandbox creation blocked |

## GitOps Repository Structure

The central [`hypershell-gitops`](https://github.com/openshift-online/hypershell-gitops)
repository is the single source of truth for **platform** desired state. It is
organized for the **pull model**: reusable `bases/` hold shared, cluster-agnostic
manifests, and each cluster gets its own directory under `clusters/` whose own
in-cluster ArgoCD applies it. There is no hub-side `Application` that targets a
remote cluster; **every** ArgoCD `Application`/`ApplicationSet` in the repo has
`destination: name: in-cluster`, so a cluster's directory *is* its own entrypoint.

```

**How a cluster self-reconciles:**

1. Install the OpenShift GitOps operator on the cluster. `bin/bootstrap <cluster>`
   does this via OLM; on ROKS (`hysh-ibm-01`) OperatorHub is unusable, so it is
   installed from raw manifests out-of-band first.
2. `oc apply -k clusters/<cluster>/gitops`, the self-contained app-of-apps. That
   cluster's in-cluster ArgoCD then reconciles everything by sync-wave: operators →
   Vault/ESO → postgres → Keycloak → HyperShell instances, all `in-cluster`.
3. Add a HyperShell instance by committing
   `clusters/<cluster>/apps/hypershell/<name>/{app.yaml,kustomization.yaml}`; the
   `hypershell` `ApplicationSet`'s git-file generator discovers the descriptor and
   creates one Application per instance automatically.
4. Onboard a new cluster by adding a `clusters/<name>/` directory (its own
   `gitops/` + `apps/` + `operators/`, referencing the shared `bases/`) and running
   `bin/bootstrap <name>`. No existing cluster's config changes, and no central
   credential store grows.

The canonical repo URL is set once per cluster in `gitops/repo-url-patch.yaml` (a
`repo-config` ConfigMap) and propagated to every `Application`/`ApplicationSet` via
a Kustomize `replacements` rule, so each cluster's ArgoCD resolves the same central
repo while syncing a different path. To fork the repo, edit only that file.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Three-tier topology | Separates concerns: Global (identity root), Cloud Hub (operations), ManagedCluster (workloads) |
| Cloud Hub as primary unit | One HA instance per cloud runs API/control-plane/database; cloud isolation for latency and compliance |
| Full operator stack on all tiers | Every cluster has ArgoCD, Vault, Keycloak, CNPG, Prometheus - but serves different purposes per tier. Because each cluster's own ArgoCD installs its stack from Git, the stack is present before any tenant workload lands. |
| Federated Keycloak chain | RH SSO → Global → Cloud Hub → ManagedCluster - identity flows down, authentication bubbles up |
| Vault per tier with distinct purposes | Cloud Hub Vault: service secrets; ManagedCluster Vault: gateway keystores |
| CNPG on all clusters | Kubernetes-native lifecycle, portable across clouds, no vendor lock-in |
| PostgreSQL on Cloud Hub as source of truth | All Gateway/ManagedCluster resource state lives in Cloud Hub database |
| ManagedClusters can be standard K8s | Maximizes deployment flexibility; only hubs need OpenShift |
| Tekton over bash scripts | Deterministic, auditable, cattle-not-pets infrastructure |
| ArgoCD on every cluster (pull model) | Every cluster runs its own ArgoCD and self-reconciles only its own path from the central GitOps repo. No cluster stores another's kubeconfig and no hub pushes manifests outward, so credential blast radius is minimized and a hub outage never stalls a spoke's platform reconciliation. (Distinct from control-plane tenant reconciliation, which remains a runtime push from the Cloud Hub.) |
| Prometheus metrics hierarchy | ManagedCluster → Cloud Hub → Global Hub; supports cloud-level and cross-cloud dashboards |
| Namespace-per-gateway | Isolation boundary for RBAC, NetworkPolicy, and resource quotas; the gateway database lives in a separate ManagedDatabase namespace |
| Terraform for provisioning | IaC for VPC, subnet, and cluster lifecycle; cloud-agnostic |
| Gateway OIDC clients on ManagedCluster | openshell CLI authenticates against Keycloak where the gateway runs (low latency) |
| Shared Ingress Gateway for Tenant gRPC | A wildcard DNS record (`*.domain`) can only resolve to a single Load Balancer. A per-tenant gateway model (1 LB per tenant) fundamentally breaks wildcard routing, requiring per-tenant DNS automation and cert management. A shared Gateway allows N tenants to securely share 1 LB, 1 wildcard cert, and 1 static DNS record via `GRPCRoute` attachments. |
