# Gateway Metrics Dashboard

**Status:** Active
**Applies to:** `components/api-server` Prometheus metrics endpoint, `components/web-console` BFF and SPA, `packages/gateway-management-ui` shared component library, `deploy/base` and `deploy/kind` Kubernetes manifests

## Purpose

Expose the live count of Gateway instances by phase - Pending, Provisioning, Running, Degraded, and Failed - as a Prometheus metric and a reusable React component, so operators can assess fleet-wide gateway health without querying Prometheus directly. The metric is collected by a custom Prometheus Collector in the API server that queries the database on each scrape; it is scraped by a Prometheus instance deployed alongside the platform; and it is surfaced to browser code through a BFF proxy route that shields the browser from direct Prometheus access.

This specification covers the metrics pipeline end to end: the API server collector, Prometheus deployment and scrape configuration, the BFF metrics route, the `GatewayMetricsDashboard` shared component, the `/metrics` SPA route, and the Kubernetes manifests required to deploy and operate the pipeline on any cluster.

### Relationship to the operational dashboard

The widgetized **operational dashboard** at `/dashboard` is specified separately in `web-console/operational-dashboard.spec.md`. That surface loads fleet-wide gateway phase counts from the same BFF route (`GET /api/metrics/gateways`, Prometheus `hypershell_gateways_total`) and maps phases to display-status buckets (`healthy`, `provisioning`, `degraded`, `failed`).

`GatewayMetricsDashboard` remains the canonical embeddable component for raw phase counts. The web console exposes Prometheus phase counts at `/metrics`. The operational dashboard and `GatewayMetricsDashboard` share the Prometheus pipeline but present different widgets and layouts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: DASH-01 -- Gateway Phase Metric

The API server SHALL expose a custom Prometheus Collector named `hypershell_gateways_total` with a `phase` label that reports the current count of Gateway instances in each known lifecycle phase. The canonical phase vocabulary SHALL be owned by `components/api-server/pkg/gatewayhealth` (single source of truth shared with the control plane); the web console mirrors it via `gatewayCanonicalPhaseStrings` in `@openshift-online/hypershell-gateway-management-ui`. See `platform/gateway-phase-vocabulary.spec.md`. The BFF metrics route and this collector SHALL emit every phase in that vocabulary on every scrape/response, even when a phase count is zero.

The Collector SHALL query the database once per scrape via `CountByPhase`  -  a single `SELECT phase, count(*) FROM gateways GROUP BY phase`  -  and emit one `GaugeValue` sample per phase. All five canonical phases SHALL be emitted on every scrape, even when a phase count is zero, so Prometheus never observes a gap in the series.

When the database query fails, the Collector SHALL emit a `prometheus.NewInvalidMetric` so the scrape registers as failed and the error is surfaced to Prometheus rather than silently dropped.

The Collector SHALL be registered exactly once using `sync.Once`; subsequent calls to `RegisterGatewayMetrics` SHALL be no-ops.

#### Scenario: All phases emitted on a healthy scrape

- GIVEN the API server is running with a reachable database
- WHEN Prometheus scrapes `GET :4433/metrics`
- THEN the response SHALL contain `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Pending"}`, `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Provisioning"}`, `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Running"}`, `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Degraded"}`, and `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Failed"}`
- AND each value SHALL equal the current count of Gateways in that phase

#### Scenario: Zero-count phases still appear

- GIVEN no Gateways are in the `Failed` phase
- WHEN Prometheus scrapes the metrics endpoint
- THEN `hypershell_gateways_total{phase="Failed"}` SHALL be present with value `0`

#### Scenario: Database error surfaces as a scrape failure

- GIVEN the database is unreachable at scrape time
- WHEN Prometheus scrapes the metrics endpoint
- THEN the scrape SHALL record a failure rather than silently returning stale or absent data

---

### Requirement: DASH-02 -- Metrics Server Reachability

The API server metrics HTTP server SHALL bind to `0.0.0.0:4433` so it is reachable from Prometheus running in a separate pod.

The default framework bind address (`localhost:4433`) restricts the metrics server to the pod's loopback interface and makes it unreachable from any other pod. The `--metrics-server-bindaddress=0.0.0.0:4433` flag SHALL be set in the API server Deployment manifest to override this default.

The `/metrics` path SHALL remain unauthenticated, consistent with the existing `auth-bypass-paths` configuration.

#### Scenario: Prometheus can reach the metrics endpoint

- GIVEN the API server Deployment includes `--metrics-server-bindaddress=0.0.0.0:4433`
- WHEN Prometheus sends `GET http://hypershell-api-server:4433/metrics` from another pod
- THEN the API server SHALL respond with HTTP 200 and the Prometheus text format

#### Scenario: Metrics endpoint requires no authentication

- GIVEN a request arrives at `/metrics` without an `Authorization` header
- WHEN the API server handles the request
- THEN it SHALL respond with HTTP 200 and SHALL NOT redirect to login or return 401

---

### Requirement: DASH-03 -- Prometheus Operator and Instance

Every cluster to which HyperShell is deployed SHALL include a Prometheus Operator and a Prometheus instance capable of scraping the `hypershell_gateways_total` metric without requiring cluster-specific manual configuration.

The Prometheus Operator SHALL be vendored as `deploy/kind/infrastructure/prometheus-operator-bundle.yaml` (pinned to a specific release) and applied as a cluster-level infrastructure dependency before application manifests, in the same layer as cert-manager.

A `Prometheus` CR, a `ServiceAccount`, a `ClusterRole`, and a `ClusterRoleBinding` SHALL be declared in `deploy/base/prometheus/` and applied as application-level resources. The `Prometheus` CR SHALL:

- Use the `prometheus` `ServiceAccount`
- Set `runAsNonRoot: true` with a non-zero `runAsUser`
- Scope `serviceMonitorSelector` to `matchLabels: app: hypershell-api-server`
- Scope `serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector` to `hypershell-system`
- Retain data for `7d` (default; sufficient for operational dashboard Prometheus range trends including gateway fleet totals and hub cluster utilization; see `platform/gateway-fleet-total-trend.spec.md` GFT-01 and `platform/hub-cluster-utilization-trends.spec.md` HCUT-01)
- Request persistent storage via a `volumeClaimTemplate`

The `ClusterRole` SHALL grant `get`, `list`, and `watch` on `nodes`, `nodes/metrics`, `services`, `endpoints`, `pods`, `configmaps`, `ingresses`, and the monitoring CRDs (`servicemonitors`, `podmonitors`, `prometheusrules`), and `GET` on the `/metrics` non-resource URL.

#### Scenario: Fresh cluster receives a working Prometheus stack

- GIVEN a cluster with no pre-existing Prometheus installation
- WHEN `deploy/kind/infrastructure` and `deploy/base` are applied
- THEN the Prometheus Operator SHALL be running
- AND a Prometheus instance SHALL be running in `hypershell-system`
- AND it SHALL successfully scrape `hypershell_gateways_total` from the API server

---

### Requirement: DASH-04 -- ServiceMonitor Scrape Configuration

A `ServiceMonitor` resource named `hypershell-api-server` SHALL exist in `hypershell-system` and SHALL be included in the base kustomization so it is applied to every cluster. The `ServiceMonitor` SHALL:

- Select Services with label `app: hypershell-api-server`
- Scrape the named port `metrics` at path `/metrics` over plain HTTP
- Use a scrape interval of `30s`

The named port `metrics` on the `hypershell-api-server` Service SHALL map to port `4433` on the pod, matching `DASH-02`.

#### Scenario: ServiceMonitor is applied as part of base

- GIVEN `deploy/base/kustomization.yaml` references `servicemonitor.yaml`
- WHEN kustomize builds the base
- THEN the `ServiceMonitor` resource SHALL be included in the rendered manifests

#### Scenario: Prometheus discovers and scrapes the API server

- GIVEN the `ServiceMonitor` and `Prometheus` CR are both present
- WHEN 30 seconds elapse after deployment
- THEN Prometheus SHALL have a scrape target for `hypershell-api-server:4433/metrics`
- AND `hypershell_gateways_total` SHALL appear in Prometheus's TSDB

---

### Requirement: DASH-05 -- BFF Metrics Proxy Route

The web-console BFF SHALL expose `GET /api/metrics/gateways` as a same-origin proxy route that queries Prometheus and returns the `hypershell_gateways_total` phase counts as JSON. The browser SHALL never contact Prometheus directly.

The BFF SHALL accept a `PROMETHEUS_URL` environment variable (validated as an HTTP or HTTPS origin, no credentials, no path) defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:9090`. The BFF SHALL accept a `PROMETHEUS_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable (integer milliseconds, 100–120000) defaulting to `10000`. Every `/api/metrics/*` route SHALL query `GET {PROMETHEUS_URL}/api/v1/query` with the configured timeout.

The response SHALL be `{ "counts": { "Running": N, "Provisioning": N, "Degraded": N, "Failed": N } }` where each value is an integer. Phases absent from the Prometheus response SHALL NOT be omitted from the JSON; the client is responsible for defaulting absent phases to zero.

When daily fleet-total history is available, the same route MAY also return optional `daily_fleet_totals` (7 UTC calendar days of fleet gateway totals) per `platform/gateway-fleet-total-trend.spec.md` GFT-03. Clients that consume only instant phase counts (`GatewayMetricsDashboard`, existing adapter logic) SHALL ignore unknown fields.

When Prometheus is unreachable or returns a non-`200` status, or when the Prometheus response body has `status != "success"`, the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `502` and `{ "error": "Metrics unavailable", "statusCode": 502 }`. The BFF SHALL NOT propagate raw Prometheus error messages to the browser.

The `/api/metrics/gateways` route SHALL be exempt from the general `/api/*` proxy handler: it does not forward to the API server, it does not require or forward a bearer token, and it does not require a Prometheus authentication header in its current form.

When OIDC is enabled, the route SHALL require **dashboard-operator authorization** matching `web-console/operational-dashboard.spec.md` OP-DASH-04 (`platform:admin` only). Authenticated callers without a dashboard-admin role SHALL receive HTTP `403`. Unauthenticated callers SHALL receive HTTP `401` or the standard BFF re-authentication response. When OIDC is disabled, no session or role is required.

Fleet-wide phase counts from Prometheus are intentionally **not** filtered by per-gateway RoleBindings; this route is restricted to dashboard administrators who are authorized to view platform-wide operational data. The operational dashboard gateway-status widget consumes this same route (`operational-dashboard.spec.md` OP-DASH-23). Per-user gateway visibility for the gateway collection table remains on the RBAC-scoped HyperShell REST list API (`web-console/architecture.spec.md` WEB-DATA-01).

#### Scenario: Successful metrics fetch

- GIVEN Prometheus is reachable at `PROMETHEUS_URL` and returns `hypershell_gateways_total` samples
- WHEN the SPA calls `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- THEN the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `200` and `{ "counts": { "Running": N, "Provisioning": N, "Degraded": N, "Failed": N } }`

#### Scenario: Prometheus unreachable

- GIVEN the BFF cannot connect to Prometheus within the configured query timeout
- WHEN the SPA calls `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- THEN the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `502` and `{ "error": "Metrics unavailable", "statusCode": 502 }`
- AND no Prometheus error detail SHALL appear in the response body

#### Scenario: Prometheus returns a non-success status

- GIVEN Prometheus is reachable but returns `{ "status": "error", ... }`
- WHEN the BFF processes the response
- THEN the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `502` and `{ "error": "Metrics unavailable", "statusCode": 502 }`

#### Scenario: Authenticated non-admin is rejected

- GIVEN OIDC is enabled and the caller has only `hypershell-users`
- WHEN the SPA calls `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- THEN the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `403`

#### Scenario: Dashboard administrator can fetch gateway phase counts

- GIVEN OIDC is enabled and the caller has `platform:admin`
- AND Prometheus returns successful `hypershell_gateways_total` samples
- WHEN the SPA calls `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- THEN the BFF SHALL respond with HTTP `200`

---

### Requirement: DASH-06 -- Dashboard Component

The `gateway-management-ui` shared library SHALL export a `GatewayMetricsDashboard` React component that renders the `hypershell_gateways_total` phase counts as five PatternFly `Card` components inside a `Gallery`.

Each card SHALL display the phase name (localized via `react-intl`) in the PatternFly semantic status color for that phase, the numeric count in a large heading, and a pluralized gateway count label. The phase-to-color mapping SHALL be:

| Phase | PatternFly token |
|---|---|
| Running | `--pf-t--global--color--status--success--default` |
| Provisioning | `--pf-t--global--color--status--info--default` |
| Degraded | `--pf-t--global--color--status--warning--default` |
| Failed | `--pf-t--global--color--status--danger--default` |

The component SHALL use TanStack Query with `queryKey: ["gateways", "metrics"]` and SHALL refetch every `30_000` ms to stay aligned with the Prometheus scrape interval.

While loading, the component SHALL render a PatternFly `Spinner` with a localized `aria-label`. When the query has errored or produced no data, the component SHALL render a PatternFly `EmptyState` with a localized error title and recovery guidance. When data is available, the component SHALL render all five phase cards, defaulting absent phases from the API response to `0`.

All user-visible strings SHALL be declared with `defineMessages` and rendered through `FormattedMessage` or `intl.formatMessage`. No literal string SHALL appear in JSX.

#### Scenario: Dashboard renders all five phase cards

- GIVEN `GET /api/metrics/gateways` returns `{ counts: { Running: 5, Provisioning: 2, Degraded: 1, Failed: 0 } }`
- WHEN `GatewayMetricsDashboard` mounts
- THEN four cards SHALL be rendered, one per phase, each showing the correct count
- AND the `Failed` card SHALL show `0`

#### Scenario: Loading state shows a spinner

- GIVEN the query has not yet resolved
- WHEN `GatewayMetricsDashboard` renders
- THEN a spinner with a localized `aria-label` SHALL be visible
- AND no phase cards SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Error state shows recovery guidance

- GIVEN `GET /api/metrics/gateways` returns HTTP `502`
- WHEN `GatewayMetricsDashboard` renders after the error
- THEN a localized error title and recovery guidance SHALL be shown
- AND no phase cards SHALL be rendered

#### Scenario: Dashboard auto-refetches

- GIVEN `GatewayMetricsDashboard` is mounted and has rendered successfully
- WHEN 30 seconds elapse
- THEN TanStack Query SHALL re-issue `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- AND the displayed counts SHALL update to reflect the new response

---

### Requirement: DASH-07 -- BFF Metrics Route Registration

The BFF SHALL recognise `/dashboard` and `/metrics` as valid SPA shell routes (returning `index.html` for direct navigation and refresh) alongside `/`, `/login`, `/gateways/new`, and `/gateways/:gatewayId`.

When OIDC is enabled, browser navigations to `/metrics` SHALL require dashboard-operator authorization (OP-DASH-04). Non-admin users SHALL be redirected to `/`. The SPA route module for `/metrics` SHALL wrap `GatewayMetricsDashboard` in the same `RequireDashboardAdmin` guard used by `/dashboard`.

The `route-contract.json` file SHALL declare `"dashboard": "dashboard"` and `"metrics": "metrics"` so the BFF and SPA share a single source of truth for each path.

Which React component renders at `/dashboard` is defined by `web-console/operational-dashboard.spec.md` (currently `OperationalDashboardPage`). This spec requires `GatewayMetricsDashboard` at `/metrics`.

#### Scenario: Direct navigation to /dashboard serves the SPA shell

- GIVEN a user navigates directly to `https://console.hypershell.localhost/dashboard`
- WHEN the BFF handles the `GET /dashboard` request
- THEN it SHALL respond with `index.html` and HTTP `200`

#### Scenario: Direct navigation to /metrics serves GatewayMetricsDashboard

- GIVEN a user navigates directly to `https://console.hypershell.localhost/metrics`
- WHEN the BFF handles the `GET /metrics` request
- THEN it SHALL respond with `index.html` and HTTP `200`
- AND the SPA SHALL render `GatewayMetricsDashboard`

---

### Requirement: DASH-08 -- Kind Local Development Configuration

When running locally under Kind, the web-console Deployment SHALL be patched with `PROMETHEUS_URL` set to the in-cluster Prometheus service address (`http://prometheus-operated.hypershell-system.svc.cluster.local:9090`) so the BFF metrics route resolves without manual configuration.

This patch SHALL live in `deploy/kind/kustomization.yaml` alongside the existing web-console OIDC patch. It SHALL NOT appear in `deploy/base` because the Prometheus service address is environment-specific.

#### Scenario: BFF resolves Prometheus in Kind

- GIVEN the Kind cluster is running with `make kind-up`
- WHEN the BFF handles `GET /api/metrics/gateways`
- THEN it SHALL forward the query to `http://prometheus-operated.hypershell-system.svc.cluster.local:9090`
- AND `GET /api/metrics/gateways` SHALL return live phase counts from Prometheus
