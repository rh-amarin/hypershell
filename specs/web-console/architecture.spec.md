# Web Console Architecture

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Status:** Active
**Applies to:** `components/web-console`, `packages/gateway-management-ui`, the browser-facing TypeScript SDK surface, and web-console build, test, deployment, and operations workflows

## Purpose

Define the technical architecture for a focused HyperShell console that lists, provisions, and connects to OpenShell gateways. This specification selects the implementation stack, establishes browser/server trust boundaries, and defines the evidence required for a secure, accessible, resilient, and maintainable console.

The web console SHALL also satisfy every applicable requirement in `standards/security/` and `standards/ui/`. This specification narrows implementation choices; it does not replace those standards.

## Architecture

```

In deployed environments, the browser SHALL communicate with the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) on the same origin. The BFF SHALL own the OAuth/OIDC tokens, session, browser-facing security controls, static application delivery, and authenticated REST proxy. Initial local development MAY use the same `/api` browser contract through a Vite development proxy while the API server runs in its no-auth development mode. The React application SHALL NOT communicate directly with an OAuth token endpoint or persist bearer tokens.

The HyperShell React application SHALL be the standalone host for the canonical gateway management UI package. The host SHALL own product-level routing, the application shell, authentication/session integration, localization and TanStack Query provider instances, and deployment-specific API construction. The gateway management UI package SHALL own the gateway-domain pages and workflows and SHALL receive host services through explicit typed integration contracts.

Direct dependency declarations SHALL use exact versions selected when the implementation or upgrade is committed. The version lines above define compatibility boundaries, not permission to use ranges in `package.json`. Every selected version and its complete resolved graph SHALL pass repository age, provenance, vulnerability, license, compatibility, and test gates. A newer major requires a deliberate specification update or an approved compatibility decision before adoption.

## Requirements

### Requirement WEB-ARCH-01: Client-Rendered Application

The web console SHALL use React Router Framework Mode configured with `ssr: false`. Routes SHALL use route modules, lazy code splitting, route error boundaries, loading behavior, and document metadata provided by the selected framework. Production delivery SHALL support direct navigation and refresh of every application route without returning a false 404.

Server-side rendering, React Server Components, and a Next.js application SHALL NOT be introduced unless an accepted architecture decision identifies a concrete requirement that SPA mode cannot meet.

**Verification:** Inspect the React Router configuration and production artifact. Open, refresh, and recover from an injected failure on representative nested routes. Confirm that the client bundle does not contain server-only code or secrets.

#### Scenario: Deep Link

- GIVEN an authenticated user opens `/gateways/{gateway_id}` directly
- WHEN the BFF receives the browser request
- THEN it SHALL return the SPA document
- AND React Router SHALL render the gateway route after checking session and resource access
- AND API and asset paths SHALL NOT fall back to the SPA document

### Requirement WEB-ARCH-02: Gateway Management Experience

HyperShell SHALL provide one focused application experience. Its landing page SHALL list every gateway visible to the authenticated user and provide gateway provisioning without a separate directory, administration shell, overview, or cluster collection. Gateway details SHALL combine operational configuration with direct OpenShell console and CLI connection actions.

The API server SHALL scope gateway visibility by per-gateway RBAC RoleBindings and the platform:admin global role -- users see gateways where they have a `gateway:owner` or `gateway:viewer` binding, or ALL gateways if they have the `platform:admin` role (see [`security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md`](../security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md) for scope-aware filtering, platform:admin global access, and the UI pagination/search requirements, and [`platform/openshell-gateway-keycloak.spec.md`](../platform/openshell-gateway-keycloak.spec.md) for the Keycloak OIDC role bridge). The console SHALL present exactly the gateways the API returns without additional client-side filtering. The API SHALL remain the authorization boundary for every read and mutation; route presence and visible controls SHALL NOT grant access. Capability-based UI controls (such as delete actions for platform:admin users) MAY be introduced when the API exposes an authorization contract, without adding a separate `/admin` route hierarchy.

The masthead and browser page titles SHALL use HyperShell product branding and the shared product mark. OpenShell terminology SHALL identify gateways, consoles, and CLI connection workflows rather than the enclosing web application.

Resource collections SHALL use a shared PatternFly table pattern with client-side search, sortable data columns, result counts, pagination, responsive row presentation, and explicit empty and no-match states. API-backed pagination and filtering SHALL be used for the gateway collection to support platform:admin users viewing all gateways across the platform. The gateway list SHALL default to 20 items per page and allow selection up to 100 items per page. Selecting an items-per-page value SHALL reset the collection to its first page and request the selected page size from the authoritative data source. The gateway search input SHALL filter by gateway name, ID, or fleet, be debounced for 300 milliseconds, and cancel in-flight requests when a new search is initiated.

The gateway collection SHALL expose the Created by column as an authoritative sortable column. The console SHALL preserve this sort in URL collection state and request creator username ordering from the API. The API SHALL apply creator ordering before pagination so that each page is part of one globally ordered result set.

#### Scenario: Sort Gateways by Creator

- GIVEN the gateway collection contains gateways created by different users
- WHEN the user sorts the Created by column
- THEN the console SHALL request the corresponding creator sort direction
- AND the API SHALL order the complete visible gateway collection by creator username before selecting the requested page
- AND the console SHALL preserve the creator sort field and direction in the collection URL

Every resource collection page SHALL expose a PatternFly refresh action in the page heading. The icon-only action SHALL have a localized accessible label, indicate or disable itself while a refresh is active, refetch the collection through its query boundary, and preserve the user's current filter, sort, and pagination state.

The initial route model SHALL include:

```text
/login
/
/gateways/new
/gateways/:gatewayId
```

Removed `/admin` paths and the former directory experience SHALL NOT be retained as aliases or redirects. Unsupported paths SHALL use the standard not-found experience so the route model remains unambiguous.

The `gatewayId` SHALL be included in gateway-detail query keys, mutations, authorization requests, breadcrumbs, and relevant telemetry dimensions. Route presence, separate shells, and hidden controls SHALL NOT be treated as authorization enforcement. The API SHALL independently authorize every operation and enforce the relationships and scope required by `standards/security/security.spec.md`.

**Verification:** Inspect route definitions and query keys. Confirm that `/` is the only gateway collection, provides provisioning, and does not expose a separate directory, administration shell, or cluster collection. Refresh each resource collection and verify that its query reruns without resetting table state. Attempt unauthorized gateway reads and mutations by changing route parameters and request bodies; the server rejects the operation without exposing protected data.

### Requirement WEB-ARCH-03: Source and Runtime Boundaries

Browser host, gateway management UI package, BFF, shared, generated SDK, and test code SHALL have explicit module boundaries and TypeScript configurations. Browser modules SHALL NOT import Node.js APIs, server environment access, OIDC tokens, session implementation, or server-only dependencies. BFF modules SHALL NOT import browser component code. The gateway management UI package SHALL NOT import application route modules, application-shell components, BFF modules, authentication/session implementations, deployment configuration, or the generated SDK.

TypeScript SHALL use strict checking. Browser and server compilation SHALL use modern ESM. Tests SHALL have a separate configuration so test globals and Node types do not leak into production browser code.

**Verification:** Run browser host, gateway management UI package, and server type checks independently, inspect build outputs, and use boundary lint rules or equivalent tests to reject prohibited imports.

### Requirement WEB-PKG-01: pnpm Workspace

HyperShell JavaScript packages SHALL use one repository-root pnpm workspace. The workspace SHALL include `components/sdk-typescript`, `packages/gateway-management-ui`, `components/web-console`, the web-console BFF, and the web-console domain probes; use one root `pnpm-lock.yaml`; and use the `workspace:` protocol for internal package dependencies. The root `package.json` SHALL be private and SHALL declare an exact pnpm version in `packageManager`.

After migration, npm, Yarn, Bun, nested lockfiles, and per-package installation workflows SHALL NOT be used for repository JavaScript packages. `shamefullyHoist` SHALL NOT be enabled. Packages SHALL declare every dependency they import.

**Verification:** Run a clean root install, enumerate workspace projects, and inspect manifests and tracked files. Confirm that the web console resolves the local SDK through `workspace:` and that no npm/Yarn/Bun lockfile remains.

#### Scenario: Workspace SDK Consumption

- GIVEN the console declares the generated SDK as a workspace dependency
- WHEN a clean frozen install runs
- THEN pnpm SHALL resolve the repository SDK rather than a registry package
- AND a missing or incompatible local SDK version SHALL fail resolution

#### Scenario: Workspace Gateway Management UI Package Consumption

- GIVEN the web console declares the gateway management UI package as a workspace dependency
- WHEN a clean frozen install and production build run
- THEN the console SHALL resolve the repository gateway management UI implementation through its declared public exports
- AND a missing or incompatible local gateway management UI version SHALL fail resolution

### Requirement WEB-PKG-04: Reusable Gateway Feature Package

The canonical gateway management interface SHALL live in the private `packages/gateway-management-ui` workspace package. The package SHALL expose an explicit, documented public surface for its gateway collection, gateway detail, and gateway provisioning pages and for the typed host integration contract they require. The standalone web console SHALL consume those public exports and SHALL NOT retain copied gateway page, mutation, query, table, dialog, or gateway-specific presentation implementations.

The gateway management UI package SHALL own:

- gateway application use cases, their entry-port contract, stable application values, driven gateway-port contract, and typed gateway-probe schemas and catalog;
- gateway and placement-cluster query keys, server-state queries, mutations, and cache invalidation behavior;
- gateway list, detail, provisioning, placement selection, rename, delete, connection, loading, empty, validation, error, success, and recovery presentation;
- canonical gateway-domain components and feature-scoped shared resource components; and
- the localized message descriptors used by those workflows.

The host SHALL own:

- application route declarations, route-parameter parsing, URL/history integration, and the product application shell;
- authentication, session, authorization bootstrap, BFF, API origin, SDK client construction, and the API, workflow-runtime, and domain-probe infrastructure adapters;
- the shared TanStack Query client and React Intl provider instances; and
- product-wide notifications, telemetry, feature flags, and runtime configuration unless an explicit package integration contract delegates a narrow behavior.

The package SHALL receive a purpose-shaped gateway application entry port and navigation behavior through typed props or a typed provider contract. Its application use-case factory SHALL receive an application-owned gateway control-plane port, a workflow-runtime port for time and invocation identity, and a typed domain-probe publisher. The gateway entry and driven ports SHALL express gateway tasks and stable application values, including the managed clusters available as gateway placement targets, rather than mirror SDK resources, transport DTOs, pagination, or a broad generated client. The host API adapter SHALL translate between the driven port and the generated gateway and managed-cluster SDK resources, including any reconciler-owned request defaults, and the host composition root SHALL wire the adapters into the package use cases. Every gateway use-case invocation and API dependency attempt SHALL publish the typed started and terminal facts required by `standards/ui/domain-observability.spec.md`. The package SHALL NOT import or construct the generated SDK, configure integrations through mutable module globals, assume a particular deployment origin, construct a second Query client, construct a second localization provider, or require a particular host router. Shared runtime libraries including React, React DOM, PatternFly, TanStack Query, and React Intl SHALL resolve to host-compatible singleton versions through peer dependency contracts or an equivalent workspace-enforced mechanism.

The internal package MAY expose TypeScript source to workspace consumers while it remains private and has one repository consumer. Publishing it to a registry or supporting external consumers SHALL require compiled JavaScript and declarations, explicit package exports, a versioning and deprecation policy, asset and CSS delivery contracts, compatibility testing against every supported host, and removal of consumer-specific source aliases or transpilation exceptions.

**Verification:** Build and test the gateway management UI package independently, inspect its public exports and dependency graph, and search both packages for duplicate gateway implementations and generated-SDK imports. Render its collection, detail, and provisioning pages in the standalone console through the public package API. Substitute a test gateway entry port and navigation adapter without React Router or a live BFF, and verify that gateway queries and mutations use the injected services and the host's Query client and localization context. Run every gateway application use case in isolation with a fake control-plane port, deterministic workflow runtime, and recording probe publisher; verify one workflow terminal fact and one dependency terminal fact for success, failure, and cancellation. Contract-test the host SDK adapter for DTO mapping, typed failures, pagination, cancellation, and reconciler-owned request defaults, and test the production probe publisher with two sinks plus a failing sink.

#### Scenario: Standalone Console Hosts the Gateway Management UI Package

- GIVEN the standalone console has constructed its SDK-backed gateway adapter, Query client, localization provider, and route adapter
- WHEN a user opens a gateway route
- THEN the route SHALL pass the gateway identifier and host integrations to the gateway management UI package
- AND the package SHALL render the canonical gateway workflow without creating competing provider or router state

#### Scenario: A Second Product Embeds Gateway Management

- GIVEN another React product uses compatible shared runtime dependencies and implements the documented gateway entry-port and navigation contracts
- WHEN it mounts a gateway management UI page within its own shell
- THEN the page SHALL use that product's navigation, localization, Query client, and gateway entry-port implementation
- AND it SHALL NOT require the HyperShell masthead, route tree, BFF implementation, or build-time source aliases

### Requirement WEB-PKG-02: Reproducible and Defensive Resolution

The repository SHALL pin pnpm and all direct npm dependencies exactly. CI and container builds SHALL install with the committed lockfile in frozen mode. The workspace configuration SHALL enforce:

- one shared workspace lockfile;
- exact saved versions;
- strict peer dependency validation;
- failure on workspace dependency cycles;
- a minimum release age of 20,160 minutes (14 days), in strict mode;
- failure when registry publish time is absent;
- lockfile supply-chain verification rather than treating the lockfile as pre-trusted;
- blocking exotic transitive dependency sources;
- explicit allowlisting of dependency lifecycle/build scripts; and
- no broad package-name or scope exception to the release-age policy.

Any exception SHALL identify an exact package version and satisfy the repository exception policy. Integrity mismatches SHALL fail closed and SHALL NOT be bypassed without an independently verified, reviewable lockfile change.

The build SHALL NOT depend on Node's bundled Corepack. Developer tooling MAY use Corepack or another bootstrap mechanism, but CI and container builds SHALL install or copy the exact declared pnpm artifact through an immutable, reviewable mechanism.

**Verification:** Modify a manifest without updating the lockfile, introduce an undeclared import, request a too-new version, remove publish-time metadata in the policy test, and add an unapproved lifecycle script. Each case fails before build or merge.

### Requirement WEB-PKG-03: Policy Migration Completeness

Adopting pnpm SHALL NOT reduce existing dependency-policy coverage. The migration that creates `pnpm-lock.yaml` SHALL also:

1. teach `scripts/check_dependency_age.py` and its tests to inspect every resolved pnpm package and every workspace importer;
2. enforce exact direct declarations while allowing only explicit `workspace:` references for local packages;
3. remove the SDK `package-lock.json`;
4. convert Makefile and CI commands from per-package npm installs to root pnpm filters or recursive commands;
5. update CI cache keys and dependency paths to use the root lockfile; and
6. document the pinned pnpm bootstrap procedure.

Until these changes land together, the existing npm SDK workflow remains the actual state, and the pnpm migration SHALL be considered incomplete.

**Verification:** Run all dependency-policy unit tests and `make check` against a pnpm-only tree. Confirm that a deliberately too-new transitive dependency in `pnpm-lock.yaml` fails the independent repository check.

### Requirement WEB-SDK-01: Browser-Compatible Generated SDK

The generated TypeScript SDK SHALL publish a modern ESM import and type declaration surface suitable for Vite and Node.js. It SHALL expose an injectable Fetch-compatible transport, a relative base URL, optional credentials/authentication behavior, typed errors, and `AbortSignal` support. Browser-facing modules SHALL NOT read `process.env` or require a bearer token.

The browser SHALL configure the SDK for same-origin `/api` requests with cookie credentials. The BFF SHALL add the server-held bearer token when proxying upstream. Generated source SHALL NOT be hand edited; generator templates or stable handwritten adapters SHALL own required behavior.

**Verification:** Build and import the SDK from both browser and BFF TypeScript configurations. Inspect the browser bundle for `process.env`, embedded API origins, tokens, and CommonJS-only shims. Cancel an in-flight route request and verify upstream cancellation where supported.

### Requirement WEB-AUTH-00: Initial No-Auth Development Mode

The initial UI MAY operate against an API server started with JWT authentication and authorization disabled. This mode SHALL be restricted to an explicit local/development environment, and the API SHALL remain bound to a loopback or otherwise isolated development interface. Shared, review, staging, and production deployments SHALL fail startup or readiness when authentication is disabled.

The browser SHALL retain the production-shaped relative `/api` contract. A Vite development proxy or a development-mode BFF SHALL forward requests to the configured local API origin and SHALL omit the bearer header. Authentication mode SHALL be selected and validated by trusted server or development-tool configuration; a browser-visible `VITE_*` flag SHALL NOT enable or disable authentication.

When routes need identity or capability data before OIDC is implemented, the development server MAY return an unmistakably synthetic development session with full development capabilities. Product code SHALL consume the same session interface used by authenticated deployments and SHALL NOT scatter no-auth conditionals through routes, components, or SDK calls.

No-auth execution SHALL NOT count as evidence for login, logout, session rotation or expiry, CSRF protection, role/capability enforcement, 401/403 recovery, or cross-resource authorization. Those behaviors SHALL use contract-faithful mocks during initial development and SHALL pass against an authenticated environment before production availability.

**Verification:** Start the documented local no-auth workflow and complete a representative gateway route without an authorization header. Attempt to start each non-development environment with authentication disabled and confirm that it fails closed. Search browser code and bundles for an authentication-bypass flag, and inspect test evidence so no-auth journeys are not labeled as authentication coverage.

### Requirement WEB-AUTH-01: OIDC Backend-for-Frontend

Production authentication SHALL use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authorization code flow with PKCE through the BFF. The BFF SHALL validate issuer, client configuration, redirect URI, state, nonce, PKCE verifier, token response, and identity claims. Access and refresh tokens SHALL remain server-side and SHALL NOT be returned to browser JavaScript.

The concrete identity provider, issuer, client registration, scopes, claims mapping, logout behavior, and session lifetime SHALL be deployment configuration with validated startup requirements. The console SHALL fail startup or health readiness when required production authentication configuration is invalid.

**Verification:** Threat-model login, callback, refresh, logout, fixation, replay, redirect, and provider-failure paths. Search source maps, browser storage, DOM, URLs, logs, and network responses for tokens.

### Requirement WEB-AUTH-02: Session and CSRF Protection

The browser session SHALL use an opaque, rotating identifier in a `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, host-only, `SameSite` cookie with the narrowest practical path and lifetime. A `__Host-` cookie name SHOULD be used where deployment constraints allow it. Session contents and OAuth tokens SHALL be stored server-side in a production-capable shared store when more than one BFF replica may serve traffic.

Every state-changing request SHALL require CSRF protection appropriate to the deployment, including origin validation and a server-validated token or equivalent robust mechanism. CORS SHALL default to same-origin only. Login SHALL rotate the session identifier; logout and terminal authentication failure SHALL revoke server-side session state and clear the cookie.

**Verification:** Attempt cross-site form, Fetch, replay, fixation, stale-session, and multi-replica requests. Inspect cookie attributes and confirm that JavaScript cannot read the session identifier.

### Requirement WEB-AUTH-03: Browser Session Contract

The BFF SHALL expose a minimal browser session resource containing only display identity, locale preferences, expiry/re-authentication state, and server-derived capabilities needed to render the console. It SHALL NOT expose provider tokens or use browser-supplied roles as authorization evidence.

The React application SHALL distinguish unauthenticated, expired, forbidden, unavailable, and insufficient-resource-access states. Session expiry during work SHALL preserve unsent form state where safe and present a clear re-authentication path.

**Verification:** Exercise initial load and mid-task expiry for read, edit, create, and destructive flows. Confirm correct recovery without disclosing protected content from a previous session.

### Requirement WEB-BFF-01: Same-Origin Static and API Service

The BFF SHALL use Node.js LTS and Fastify to provide:

- OIDC login, callback, logout, and session endpoints;
- an authenticated `/api/*` reverse proxy to the HyperShell REST API;
- the immutable built SPA assets and non-cacheable application document;
- liveness and readiness endpoints independent of authenticated product routes;
- security headers, request limits, structured logs, and trace propagation; and
- explicit 404 behavior for unknown API, asset, and server routes.

The proxy SHALL use an allowlisted upstream origin, remove untrusted hop-by-hop and identity headers, set the server-held authorization header, impose timeouts and body limits, preserve safe API status semantics, and cancel upstream work after client disconnect where supported.

The production BFF SHALL forward the gateway management UI package's `/api/hypershell/v1/*` requests to the configured HyperShell API; a Vite development proxy SHALL NOT be the only working API path. The BFF SHALL validate or replace the browser correlation identifier, include it in structured request context, and propagate it upstream. Browser application routes SHALL share one route contract with the production BFF or have an automated parity test; a removed route SHALL NOT remain in a server allowlist and a newly declared route SHALL NOT return a server 404 on direct navigation or refresh.

**Verification:** Test routing precedence, header sanitation, correlation validation and propagation, timeouts, cancellation, large bodies, upstream failures, and SPA fallback behavior. Start the built production BFF against a recording API and complete a representative gateway list request through `/api/hypershell/v1/gateways`. Request `/`, `/gateways/new`, and a representative `/gateways/{id}` directly from the BFF and verify application HTML; verify unknown API, asset, health, and server paths do not receive the SPA document. Confirm that an arbitrary URL cannot turn the BFF into an open proxy.

### Requirement WEB-DATA-01: Server-State Ownership

TanStack Query SHALL own REST response data, asynchronous request state, caching, invalidation, and mutations. Query keys SHALL be factories that include resource kind, resource identifier, and normalized request parameters. Mutation success SHALL update or invalidate only affected keys.

Gateway collection queries SHALL request exactly one authoritative API page and SHALL retain `page`, `size`, and `total` metadata. Search and sort values SHALL be normalized before entering both the application port and query key. Incremental gateway search SHALL debounce rapid input for 300 milliseconds so one typing burst produces one authoritative request. The default gateway collection experience SHALL NOT call an all-pages helper or loop until the API total has been loaded. Related placement names for the visible page SHALL be resolved with at most one additional managed-cluster list request after non-empty cluster identifiers have been normalized and deduplicated. The collection SHALL NOT issue one managed-cluster request per gateway row.

Gateway placement searches SHALL debounce rapid input for 300 milliseconds and request exactly one authoritative managed-cluster API page for the normalized search value. Placement search and detail results SHALL remain fresh for 60 seconds so reopening the selector or remounting a placement name within that window does not issue another request. Search text SHALL retain literal semantics for API filter quotation, wildcard, and escape characters. The placement selector SHALL NOT call an all-pages helper or exhaust the managed-cluster collection before rendering. When more matching clusters exist than the returned page, the interface SHALL tell the user to refine the search rather than presenting the page as the complete result set.

React Router loaders MAY verify session and route access and prefill the Query client. Loader data and React Context SHALL NOT become competing REST caches. Redux, Zustand, MobX, or another global state store SHALL NOT be added until a recorded design decision demonstrates cross-route client-only state that React, URL state, and TanStack Query cannot manage clearly.

Query and mutation functions SHALL call application use cases through the narrow boundary in `standards/ui/hexagonal-architecture.spec.md`; they SHALL NOT call the generated SDK directly. TanStack Query remains the presentation-side owner of server-state policy and SHALL NOT be hidden behind a generic query port.

**Verification:** Inventory state ownership and query keys. Navigate between gateways and list views with different request parameters and confirm that cached data never crosses resource boundaries. With an API total larger than one page, verify initial render issues one gateway list request, page/search/sort changes issue one request for the normalized state, Back/Forward restores that state, and an inconsistent response is surfaced rather than presented as a complete collection. Cold-render the maximum gateway page with distinct managed-cluster identifiers and confirm placement resolution issues one managed-cluster list request and no per-cluster get requests. Repeat with duplicate identifiers and confirm they are deduplicated. A missing cluster or failed placement batch SHALL preserve the gateway rows and render their placement values as unavailable.

### Requirement WEB-DATA-02: URL and Local State

Pagination, filtering, search, sorting, selected gateway, and other shareable view state SHALL be encoded in validated URL path or search parameters. Ephemeral interaction state SHALL remain local to the narrowest component. Context SHALL be limited to stable cross-cutting services such as session, locale, feature flags, and the Query client.

Sensitive values, server response caches, bearer tokens, and unsanitized operational data SHALL NOT be persisted in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, URL parameters, or an initial service-worker cache.

**Verification:** Copy and reopen representative list URLs, use browser back/forward navigation, switch users in one browser profile, and inspect browser storage and cache contents.

### Requirement WEB-DATA-03: Retry, Refresh, and Cancellation

Queries SHALL have explicit freshness and retry policies by data class. The client SHALL NOT retry authorization, validation, conflict, or other deterministic 4xx responses. Mutations SHALL NOT retry automatically unless the operation is proven idempotent. Network and eligible 5xx query retries SHALL be bounded, use backoff, and expose final recovery guidance.

Resources in non-terminal lifecycle states MAY use bounded adaptive polling while the document is visible. Polling SHALL pause or slow when hidden, stop at terminal state, recover after reconnect, and avoid refetching unrelated resources. Global polling SHALL NOT be used. SSE or WebSocket dependencies SHALL wait for an authenticated API event contract.

Route changes and component disposal SHALL cancel obsolete requests with `AbortSignal` where supported.

Each request path SHALL have one explicit retry owner. A TanStack Query `AbortSignal` SHALL propagate through the application use case and API port to the generated SDK.

**Verification:** Simulate offline, reconnect, tab hiding, 400, 401, 403, 409, 429, 500, timeout, and slow cancellation. Inspect request count and user-visible state.

### Requirement WEB-DATA-04: Forms and Runtime Validation

Nontrivial forms SHALL use React Hook Form with Zod schemas and PatternFly form components. A form's Zod schema SHALL integrate through the React Hook Form resolver as the single client-side schema-validation path; a successful `handleSubmit` callback SHALL consume resolver output without parsing the same values again. Zod SHALL validate untrusted browser/runtime shapes where compile-time TypeScript types provide no runtime guarantee. The API remains authoritative for domain rules and authorization.

Validation SHALL occur at submit and appropriate blur/interaction boundaries rather than producing disruptive errors for every keystroke. Forms SHALL preserve user input across recoverable failures, prevent accidental duplicate submission, focus or summarize errors accessibly, and map server field and global errors without exposing sensitive details.

Destructive and conflicting changes SHALL follow the interaction and recovery requirements in `standards/ui/`.

**Verification:** Exercise keyboard-only entry, server/client validation disagreement, duplicate submission, network failure, version conflict, session expiry, cancellation, and successful resubmission. Lint presentation components against direct schema `safeParse` calls and inspect form setup for a resolver.

### Requirement WEB-UI-01: PatternFly-First Presentation

The implementation SHALL follow `standards/ui/patternfly.spec.md`. It SHALL use PatternFly 6 packages from a compatible release set and install optional PatternFly packages only when a feature consumes them. CSS Modules MAY fill product-specific layout or presentation gaps using PatternFly semantic tokens and logical properties.

Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI, Chakra UI, another general-purpose component system, Sass, and a CSS-in-JS styling system SHALL NOT be introduced. Charts, terminals, editors, and other specialized widgets MAY be added only with a concrete feature, accessibility review, bundle assessment, and documented PatternFly integration.

**Verification:** Inspect dependencies, imports, rendered class names, tokens, and CSS. Map every custom component to the admission evidence required by the PatternFly standard.

### Requirement WEB-UI-02: Shared Component Evidence

Canonical shared components SHALL have discoverable Storybook stories for applicable default, loading, empty, error, permission, overflow, localization, responsive, and interaction states. Gateway-domain stories SHALL import the canonical gateway management UI package public surface rather than a copied or private console implementation. Storybook SHALL be a development and verification surface, not a separately deployed production dependency unless explicitly required.

React components SHALL be implemented semantically and tested through user-observable behavior. Tests SHALL NOT depend primarily on implementation details, internal component state, or snapshots of large markup trees.

**Verification:** Compare the shared component inventory with stories and interaction tests. Run component accessibility checks and manually verify representative keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, touch, reduced-motion, RTL, and long-content states.

### Requirement WEB-UI-03: Gateway Connection Experience

The gateway landing page SHALL make the shortest useful OpenShell workflow available. Every visible gateway SHALL provide its name, readiness, placement cluster, creation date, endpoint, a link to gateway details, and a row actions menu. The row actions menu SHALL provide the gateway-console link, a copyable `openshell gateway add` command, gateway renaming, and gateway deletion. Copying from the menu SHALL produce visible success or failure feedback. When the gateway table reflows into its narrow responsive presentation, each row's actions trigger SHALL remain in the top-end corner rather than become a trailing content row. The same console, CLI connection, rename, and delete capabilities SHALL remain available on the gateway detail page. The gateway detail page SHALL organize these capabilities into the tabbed experience defined in `WEB-UI-05`. The login command SHALL appear in `Connection`, service-account management SHALL appear in `Service accounts`, and operational values SHALL appear in `Details`. Rename and delete SHALL be grouped in a PatternFly Actions dropdown at the far right of the header so infrequent management operations do not compete with connection workflows, and the Open gateway console action SHALL remain a header action.

Gateway renaming SHALL use the existing `PATCH /gateways/{id}` contract and send only the trimmed `name` field. Both rename entry points SHALL use the same required-field validation, prevent unchanged or duplicate submission, preserve user input with recovery guidance on failure, update gateway detail and breadcrumb cache state, invalidate the collection, and provide visible success feedback.

Gateway deletion SHALL use the existing `DELETE /gateways/{id}` contract. Both delete entry points SHALL present the same explicit confirmation before commitment, prevent duplicate submission while deletion is pending, preserve the confirmation with recovery guidance on failure, and provide an accurate success notification after deletion. Successful deletion from a detail page SHALL return the user to the gateway collection and invalidate both collection and deleted-detail query state.

The `Connection` tab SHALL show this OpenShell CLI installation command in a code block:

```bash
curl -LsSf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-online/hypershell/main/scripts/install-openshell.sh \
  | OPENSHELL_VERSION=v<gateway-version> sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

The installer SHALL download only the CLI archive from the selected NVIDIA
release and verify its SHA-256 checksum before installation. It SHALL install
the CLI in `~/.local/bin` without starting a local gateway. It SHALL reject an
unsupported platform, invalid version, missing checksum, or checksum mismatch.
The command SHALL add the install directory to the current shell PATH.

The command SHALL use the read-only `gateway_version` value that the control
plane reconciles from the gateway runtime. It SHALL encode the version as a safe
shell argument. Before it sets `OPENSHELL_VERSION`, it SHALL remove the first
hyphen and all text after that hyphen from the reported version. For example,
`v0.0.109-rh9a8f8` SHALL become `v0.0.109`. It SHALL NOT require an installed
OpenShell CLI or `jq`. The installation prerequisite and its code block SHALL
appear before the one-time setup commands. The `openshell gateway add` command
SHALL be in the same code
block as the provider setup commands and SHALL appear before those provider
commands. All command code blocks in the `Connection` tab SHALL use the same
shared component and shell syntax highlighting. The installation code block
SHALL not show line numbers. A small link named `View installation
documentation` SHALL remain below the code block and SHALL open the NVIDIA
OpenShell installation documentation in a new tab. The UI SHALL not show the
installation prerequisite, its documentation link, or its command until the
gateway is ready to connect and has a reconciled version. A gateway is ready to
connect only when its phase is `Running` and its endpoint is available.

The generated command SHALL include the gateway name, OIDC issuer, OIDC client ID, OIDC audience, and endpoint. Values SHALL be encoded as safe shell arguments before being presented for copying. Copy controls SHALL have an accessible name and visible success feedback, and the full command SHALL remain available at narrow widths without causing page-level horizontal overflow.

Preview placeholders MAY be used while the API contract is under development, but they SHALL be isolated to explicit Storybook, test, or development fixtures and clearly removable. Production data mappers SHALL preserve missing connection values as unavailable and SHALL NOT replace them with a preview gateway's endpoint, console URL, issuer, client ID, or audience. Production connection values SHALL come from an authorized server response and SHALL NOT be inferred from unrelated deployment fields or embedded as build-time environment constants. Console and CLI controls SHALL be absent or disabled with truthful explanation until all values required by that action are available.

Gateway status presentation SHALL use an explicit bounded mapping and the compact inline status pattern used by Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console: a semantic icon or inline progress indicator followed by visible plain text, without a label or chip container. Ready, Running, and other success states SHALL use the PatternFly semantic success status and its brand success-green token, not the non-status green palette; known failure states SHALL use their defined error or warning semantics; pending or transitional states SHALL use neutral or informational semantics; and unknown, absent, or unrecognized values SHALL use gray. Status text SHALL remain visible so color is never the only carrier.

While the active gateway collection page contains a gateway whose lifecycle is pending, transitional, or not yet initialized, the UI SHALL poll that page with one list request approximately every five seconds. It SHALL also use a bounded polling window when a settled routed Gateway waits for its console address or reconciled runtime version. It SHALL NOT issue one polling request per row or poll inactive pagination requests. The gateway detail page SHALL use the same rules and interval for its selected gateway. Rapid polling SHALL stop when no Gateway needs these updates, when the bounded window ends, when the owning view unmounts, or while the document is in the background.

**Verification:** Exercise the landing and detail experiences with zero, one, many, long-named, unauthorized, and unavailable gateways. Verify this command order: OpenShell installation, gateway registration, and provider setup. Verify that gateway registration and provider setup use one code block. Verify that all command code blocks use the same component and shell syntax highlighting. Verify that the installation command uses the reconciled runtime version, removes a postfix that starts with `-`, does not call `openshell` or `jq`, uses the specified continuation lines, and has no line numbers. Verify that the installation documentation link has the specified name, size, destination, and new-tab behavior. Give a `Provisioning` gateway an endpoint and version and verify that the installation prerequisite, documentation link, and command are absent. Give a `Running` gateway an endpoint but no version and verify the same result. Then publish the version and verify that bounded polling shows the command without a manual refresh. Feed an API gateway with every connection field absent and verify that no preview URL or command appears in the production-composed page. Exercise every documented gateway status plus an unrecognized future value and verify semantic inline indicators with visible text and no label or chip container. Return an uninitialized lifecycle followed by Pending, Provisioning, and Running responses; verify the active collection page uses one periodic list request, detail uses one periodic detail request, each view updates to Running without user input, and polling then stops. Verify inactive pages and background documents do not poll. Verify creation dates are localized and sort through the API's creation-timestamp field. Copy and execute representative safe commands, inject shell metacharacters into every source field, verify the console destination, and test keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, and narrow viewport behavior. At the responsive table breakpoint, verify the row actions trigger occupies the top-end action-cell position and does not appear below the labeled row values.

### Requirement WEB-UI-03A: Platform Admin Gateway List

Users with the `platform:admin` role SHALL see all gateways in the platform through the gateway collection view. The gateway list SHALL use server-side pagination with API-backed filtering to efficiently handle large gateway collections.

The gateway list SHALL:

- Display all gateways visible to the authenticated user (scoped per RBAC as defined in `security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md`)
- Default to 20 items per page
- Allow page size selection up to 100 items per page
- Include a search input that filters by gateway name, ID, or fleet
- Debounce search input for 300 milliseconds
- Cancel in-flight search requests when new search input is received
- Display total gateway count across all pages
- Show pagination controls (page number, previous/next, items per page selector)
- Render delete actions on all gateway rows for platform:admin users
- Require confirmation via a modal dialog before deleting any gateway
- Display a platform:admin indicator (badge or status) when the user has this role

Platform administrators SHALL be able to delete any gateway from the list view. The delete action SHALL:

- Trigger a confirmation modal with the gateway name
- On confirmation, call `DELETE /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/{id}`
- On success, remove the gateway from the list and display a success notification
- Invalidate the gateway collection query to refresh the list
- Handle failures with clear error messaging and recovery guidance

**Verification:** Authenticate as a platform:admin user with 100+ gateways in the system. Verify the list displays 20 items by default, search filters results with 300ms debounce, pagination controls work correctly, total count is accurate, and delete actions are visible and functional. Verify rapid search input cancels previous requests. Authenticate as a non-admin user and verify delete actions are not visible and the list shows only owned/viewable gateways.

#### Scenario: Platform admin sees all gateways with pagination

- GIVEN user A has `platform:admin`
- AND there are 50 gateways in the platform owned by various users
- WHEN user A navigates to the gateway list page
- THEN all 50 gateways are accessible through pagination
- AND the page shows "Showing 1-20 of 50"
- AND pagination controls allow navigation to additional pages

#### Scenario: Platform admin searches for a gateway

- GIVEN user A has `platform:admin`
- AND there are 100 gateways in the platform
- WHEN user A types "prod" in the search input
- THEN the input is debounced for 300ms
- AND only one API request is sent after the debounce period
- AND only gateways matching "prod" in name, ID, or fleet are displayed
- AND the total count reflects filtered results

#### Scenario: Platform admin deletes a gateway from list

- GIVEN user A has `platform:admin`
- AND user A is viewing the gateway list
- WHEN user A clicks the delete action for gateway "test-gw-1"
- THEN a confirmation modal appears with the gateway name
- WHEN user A confirms deletion
- THEN `DELETE /api/hypershell/v1/gateways/test-gw-1` is called
- AND on success, the gateway is removed from the list
- AND a success notification is displayed
- AND the list is refreshed

#### Scenario: Non-admin user does not see delete actions

- GIVEN user A has `gateway:owner` on gw-1 only
- AND user A does NOT have `platform:admin`
- WHEN user A views the gateway list
- THEN user A sees only gw-1
- AND the delete action is not visible in the row actions menu
- AND user A cannot delete gateways they do not own

### Requirement WEB-UI-04: Gateway Placement Selection

The gateway provisioning form SHALL collect a gateway name and one placement cluster. It SHALL use the PatternFly searchable single-select pattern and populate remote placement options from the managed-cluster API. The control SHALL display each managed cluster by name, distinguish options with available provider and region context, and SHALL NOT offer cluster creation or registration.

The gateway collection and gateway details SHALL display the managed-cluster name for every gateway with a non-empty `cluster_id`. Gateway details SHALL resolve one stable cluster identifier through the managed-cluster API and provide a direct retry action when name resolution fails. The gateway collection SHALL normalize and deduplicate the visible page's non-empty cluster identifiers through one application-owned normalizer, use that same normalized sequence for the batch cache key and API request, resolve it through one bounded managed-cluster list request, and cache that batch for 60 seconds. Managed-cluster typeahead results SHALL be bounded by the application-owned default collection page size. Both experiences SHALL render explicit loading and unavailable states without exposing the raw identifier as a display fallback. Gateways with an empty `cluster_id` SHALL display `Hub cluster` in both experiences.

`Hub cluster (default)` SHALL be the initially selected placement and SHALL represent the cluster that hosts HyperShell. Selecting this option SHALL send an empty `cluster_id`. Selecting a managed cluster SHALL send that cluster's stable identifier as `cluster_id`. Typing text that does not identify a selected option SHALL NOT silently retain or submit a different placement. Pressing Escape during an uncommitted search SHALL close the popup and restore the input and form value to the last accepted placement.

The form SHALL NOT collect a Kubernetes namespace, fleet identifier, release identifier, or database identifier. The host adapter SHALL omit namespace because the API server assigns it, and SHALL send empty fleet, release, and database identifiers until those values have a user-facing or reconciler-defined contract. Loading, no-match, partial-page, managed-cluster API failure, retry, and cancellation states SHALL be explicit. A managed-cluster API failure SHALL NOT prevent provisioning to the hub cluster, but the interface SHALL explain that remote placements are unavailable and provide a retry action.

Managed-cluster search SHALL execute at the API through the gateway application use case and its application-owned port. Search values SHALL be normalized in the query identity, rapid input SHALL be debounced for 250 milliseconds, obsolete requests SHALL be cancelled, and the query SHALL request only the first bounded result page. Placement results SHALL remain fresh for 60 seconds. Cluster list and gateway provisioning requests SHALL retain one correlation context each and publish their required workflow and dependency probes.

**Verification:** Inspect the composed provisioning form, application port, query key, freshness policy, SDK adapter, request payload, and probe recordings. Exercise keyboard and screen-reader selection, Escape from an uncommitted search, rapid and slow search input, literal `%`, `_`, apostrophe, and backslash search values, warm-cache remount, no-match, more-results, slow load, API failure and retry on both provisioning and gateway details, cancellation, hub provisioning, and managed-cluster provisioning. Confirm that one rapid typing burst produces one API search, warm placement data is reused for 60 seconds, the form contains no namespace or cluster-creation controls, the default payload uses `cluster_id: ""` and omits namespace, the response contains the server-assigned namespace, and a selected managed cluster uses its identifier without changing the other reconciler-owned identifiers.

#### Scenario: Provision on the Hub Cluster

- GIVEN the provisioning form has loaded
- WHEN the user keeps `Hub cluster (default)` selected and provisions a gateway
- THEN the request SHALL contain an empty `cluster_id`
- AND the request SHALL omit namespace
- AND the created Gateway response SHALL contain the server-assigned namespace

#### Scenario: Provision on a Managed Cluster

- GIVEN the managed-cluster API returns an existing cluster
- WHEN the user searches for and selects that cluster and provisions a gateway
- THEN the request SHALL contain the selected managed cluster identifier as `cluster_id`
- AND the interface SHALL NOT offer to create or register a cluster

#### Scenario: Managed Clusters Are Unavailable

- GIVEN the managed-cluster API request fails
- WHEN the provisioning form reports the failure
- THEN `Hub cluster (default)` SHALL remain available for selection
- AND the user SHALL be able to retry loading managed clusters without losing valid gateway form input

#### Scenario: Gateway Collection Shows Placement Names

- GIVEN a gateway has a non-empty `cluster_id` for an existing managed cluster
- WHEN the gateway collection renders that row
- THEN the Cluster column SHALL show the managed cluster's name
- AND it SHALL NOT show the managed cluster identifier

#### Scenario: Gateway Details Show Placement Names

- GIVEN a gateway has a non-empty `cluster_id` for an existing managed cluster
- WHEN the gateway details render
- THEN the Cluster value SHALL show the managed cluster's name
- AND it SHALL NOT show the managed cluster identifier

### Requirement WEB-UI-05: Gateway Detail Connection and Service Accounts

The gateway detail page SHALL present a connection-forward experience. The page header SHALL retain the gateway name, inline status, the Open gateway console action, and the rename/delete Actions dropdown defined in `WEB-UI-03`.

Below the header, the page SHALL use PatternFly Tabs with these primary tabs in order:

1. `Connection`
2. `Service accounts`
3. `Details`

The selected tab SHALL use the validated `tab` search parameter per `WEB-DATA-02`. Its values SHALL be `connection`, `service-accounts`, and `details`. A shared URL and browser refresh SHALL reopen the selected tab. Browser Back and Forward SHALL restore the previous selection. A missing or invalid value SHALL select `Connection`.

The `Details` tab SHALL contain the existing gateway description list (status, cluster, endpoint, CLI connection command, namespace, and release identifier), using the same values, loading, unavailable, and placement-resolution behavior required elsewhere in this specification.

The `Connection` tab SHALL guide the user through three ordered steps using an accessible ordered structure with a visible label and description for each step:

1. **Log in to the gateway.** The step SHALL present the `openshell gateway add` command produced from the authorized gateway response as a read-only PatternFly Clipboard Copy value, using the same command construction, shell-argument encoding, and missing-value handling required by `WEB-UI-03`. When required connection values are absent, the step SHALL explain that login is unavailable rather than present an incomplete command.

2. **Add a Claude on Vertex AI provider.** The step SHALL present, as its primary read-only Clipboard Copy value, one `openshell provider create` command for the `google-vertex-ai` provider that reads credentials and configuration from the user's own environment rather than requiring hand-edited secrets. An expandable details disclosure SHALL document the Application Default Credentials prerequisite, the environment variables the command reads, the command that routes a Claude model through the provider, and the sandbox routing caveats, including reaching Vertex through `inference.local` and not setting `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` inside the sandbox. The step SHALL NOT display, request, or persist Google Cloud credentials, service-account keys, project identifiers, or access tokens in the browser.

3. **Create a sandbox.** The step SHALL present an `openshell sandbox create` command that names a sandbox, specifies CPU and memory resource requests and limits via a `--driver-config-json` flag, attaches the provider from step 2, and launches the agent, as a read-only Clipboard Copy value. The default resource values SHALL be CPU requests `100m`, CPU limits `500m`, memory requests `512Mi`, and memory limits `512Mi`.

The `Service accounts` tab SHALL own the gateway-scoped automation identity workflow. It SHALL include the heading, create action, responsive collection, one-time credential handoff, command groups, and lifecycle actions defined in [`openshell-gateway-service-accounts.spec.md`](../platform/openshell-gateway-service-accounts.spec.md).

The tab SHALL use the canonical shared resource-table components. It SHALL consume service-account operations through the gateway management UI package's application port and the host API adapter.

The UI SHALL obtain the create action, allowed roles, and account-scope explanation from the server-provided service-account capabilities. It SHALL not infer them from browser session roles or visible rows.

The one-time view SHALL keep the client secret in local component state only. It SHALL not place the secret in a TanStack Query query or mutation cache, navigation state, application context, or a domain probe.

Every Clipboard Copy control SHALL have a localized accessible name and visible success feedback, and each command SHALL remain usable at narrow viewport widths without causing page-level horizontal overflow. Step commands other than the login command describe the OpenShell CLI workflow and SHALL NOT be presented as authorized live values from the HyperShell API; user- or environment-specific values the console cannot supply SHALL be shown as clearly editable placeholders or read from the user's own environment by the CLI. The provider and sandbox steps SHALL NOT issue HyperShell API requests.

**Verification:** Open a gateway detail page and confirm `Connection` is selected by default. Confirm that `Service accounts` is the second tab and `Details` renders the former description list unchanged. Confirm that the `Connection` tab does not contain a service-account management link. Switch tabs and confirm the URL, refresh, and browser Back and Forward restore selection. Confirm a missing or invalid value selects `Connection`. Copy each interactive command and verify visible feedback and accessible names. Feed a gateway with missing connection values and confirm that the login step reports the problem without a partial command. Confirm that the provider details retain the ADC prerequisite, environment variables, inference-routing command, and `inference.local` and `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` caveats. Confirm that the provider and sandbox steps issue no HyperShell API requests and expose no Google Cloud credentials. Exercise the service-account collection, create form, one-time view, setup commands, revoke, delete, loading, empty, no-match, error, and uncertain-create states. Register both an interactive and a service-account connection to one gateway and confirm that their local aliases do not collide. Confirm the client secret never enters query data, navigation state, context, probes, logs, or URLs. Exercise keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, localization, RTL, and narrow-viewport behavior for the complete journey.

#### Scenario: Connection Tab Is the Default

- GIVEN an authenticated user opens a gateway detail page
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN the `Connection` tab SHALL be selected
- AND the three ordered connection steps SHALL be visible
- AND the `Service accounts` tab SHALL be available
- AND the operational description list SHALL be available under the `Details` tab

#### Scenario: Login Command Uses Authorized Values

- GIVEN a gateway whose response includes endpoint and OIDC connection values
- WHEN the `Connection` tab renders the login step
- THEN the `openshell gateway add` command SHALL contain those values encoded as safe shell arguments
- AND copying it SHALL produce visible success feedback

#### Scenario: Provider Step Reads the Environment

- GIVEN the user has configured Application Default Credentials
- WHEN the user copies the provider step command
- THEN the command SHALL create the `google-vertex-ai` provider from the user's environment
- AND the browser SHALL NOT display or transmit Google Cloud credentials
- AND the expandable details SHALL document the ADC prerequisite, required environment variables, model routing, and sandbox routing caveats

#### Scenario: Missing Connection Values

- GIVEN a gateway whose endpoint or OIDC values are absent
- WHEN the `Connection` tab renders the login step
- THEN the step SHALL explain that gateway login is unavailable
- AND it SHALL NOT present an incomplete `openshell gateway add` command

### Requirement WEB-I18N-01: Localization from First Implementation

React Intl / FormatJS SHALL own user-facing application messages from the first implementation. Messages SHALL use complete ICU expressions; concatenated translatable fragments and ad hoc pluralization are prohibited. CI SHALL extract and validate message catalogs and reject missing or malformed messages for supported release locales.

Dates, times, time zones, numbers, units, and plural rules SHALL use `Intl` through the localization layer. Moment.js, Day.js, or another general date library SHALL NOT be added without a requirement that native `Intl` and platform date primitives cannot meet.

Pseudo-localization and an RTL locale SHALL be part of regular verification even before a second production locale ships.

**Verification:** Extract messages, build with pseudo-localized and RTL catalogs, and test expansion, mixed direction, time-zone transitions, plural categories, and missing translations on critical routes.

### Requirement WEB-QUAL-01: Static Analysis

The web workspace SHALL run:

- TypeScript strict checking for browser, server, and tests;
- ESLint flat configuration with type-aware `typescript-eslint` rules;
- React Hooks and React Compiler lint rules;
- JSX accessibility rules;
- TanStack Query rules;
- FormatJS message rules; and
- Prettier verification.

Lint suppression SHALL be narrow and explain the violated rule's inapplicability. React Compiler MAY be piloted only after compatibility testing with React Router, PatternFly, Storybook, and the production build. It SHALL NOT be treated as a substitute for profiling, correct state ownership, or deliberate memoization.

**Verification:** Run all checks from the workspace root and introduce representative type, hook, accessibility, query, and message violations to confirm enforcement.

### Requirement WEB-QUAL-02: Test Layers

The web console SHALL use:

- Vitest for unit and route/component integration tests;
- Testing Library and `user-event` for behavior through accessible user interactions;
- MSW for reusable request/response behavior at the network boundary;
- Storybook with interaction and accessibility checks for shared component states; and
- Playwright for end-to-end journeys in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Jest or Cypress SHALL NOT be added unless an accepted decision demonstrates a test requirement the selected tools do not meet.

Mocks SHALL preserve the API's production status codes, latency, authorization, validation, pagination, and error envelope. A test SHALL NOT claim end-to-end coverage when the BFF or API boundary is mocked.

At least one production-shaped integration test SHALL start the BFF with a recording upstream and exercise the same-origin API path used by the built browser. Browser route coverage SHALL include direct BFF navigation and refresh for every route shape, not only client-side navigation from `/`.

**Verification:** Inspect the test inventory and run representative suites. Confirm that contract drift in an API fixture produces a failure rather than being hidden by permissive mocks.

### Requirement WEB-QUAL-03: Change and Release Gates

Every pull request affecting the web workspace SHALL pass frozen installation, dependency policy, formatting, lint, type checks, unit/integration tests, Storybook build and checks, a production build, a production-BFF API and direct-route smoke test, and critical Chromium journeys. The production smoke test SHALL fail when the browser's API namespace is not proxied, when a declared browser route returns a server 404, or when production gateway mapping supplies preview connection constants. Main/release verification SHALL add Firefox, WebKit, visual regression for critical layouts, pseudo-locale/RTL coverage, and the broader accessibility matrix required by `standards/ui/verification.spec.md`.

Automated accessibility checks SHALL use axe-compatible rules but SHALL NOT be reported as complete accessibility evidence. Manual keyboard, screen reader, zoom/reflow, touch, reduced-motion, and locale checks remain required at the risk-based cadence in the UI verification standard.

**Verification:** Inspect component-aware CI, stable summary gates, test artifacts, browser versions, exclusions, and release evidence.

### Requirement WEB-DEPLOY-01: Reproducible Container

The web console SHALL build in a multi-stage container from digest-pinned images. The build stage SHALL use the pinned Node.js LTS and pnpm versions with a frozen lockfile. The runtime SHALL contain only the BFF production closure, built static assets, required metadata, and trusted certificates.

The runtime container and Kubernetes workload SHALL run as non-root, disallow privilege escalation, drop all capabilities, use the default seccomp profile, and use a read-only root filesystem with explicitly mounted writable paths only when required. It SHALL expose port 8080, define resource requests/limits, and provide independent liveness and readiness probes.

**Verification:** Rebuild from a clean checkout, inspect image contents and dependency closure, scan the image, start it with the production security context, and exercise probes and graceful shutdown.

### Requirement WEB-DEPLOY-02: Assets and Runtime Configuration

Content-hashed static assets SHALL use long-lived immutable caching and compression. The application HTML and deployment configuration SHALL not use long-lived caching. Source maps SHALL be uploaded privately to the selected error system or retained as protected build artifacts; they SHALL NOT be publicly served by default.

`VITE_*` variables SHALL be treated as public compile-time constants and SHALL never contain credentials, tokens, private origins, or other secrets. Environment-specific server settings and sensitive configuration SHALL be read and validated by the BFF at runtime. Any browser-visible runtime configuration endpoint SHALL expose only an allowlisted, non-sensitive schema.

No service worker or offline mutation queue SHALL ship initially. Either feature requires an explicit cache invalidation, privacy, session-transition, update, conflict, and recovery design.

**Verification:** Inspect built JavaScript, source maps, cache headers, compressed responses, runtime configuration, and browser caches before and after logout and deployment replacement.

### Requirement WEB-SEC-01: Browser Security Headers

The BFF SHALL set a reviewed Content Security Policy, frame-ancestor restriction, MIME sniffing protection, referrer policy, permissions policy, and HSTS where TLS deployment permits it. CSP SHALL begin in report-only mode while third-party and framework behavior is inventoried, then become enforcing before production release. Unsafe script execution and unbounded third-party origins SHALL NOT be accepted as permanent defaults.

User- or API-provided text SHALL render as text by default. Raw HTML rendering requires sanitization, a documented need, and adversarial tests. URLs, redirects, downloads, and external links SHALL use allowlisted schemes and destinations appropriate to their purpose.

**Verification:** Run header and CSP tests, inject representative markup and URL payloads, and review CSP reports. Confirm that framing and cross-origin data access fail as designed.

### Requirement WEB-OBS-01: User and Web Performance Signals

The browser SHALL report Core Web Vitals using `web-vitals` and SHALL measure critical-task completion, failure, abandonment, client errors, and recovery outcomes required by `standards/ui/trust-performance.spec.md`. Metrics SHALL use stable route templates rather than raw identifiers and SHALL exclude query strings, secrets, user-entered values, tokens, and sensitive resource content.

Domain and critical-task facts SHALL enter through the typed, fan-out probe publisher required by `standards/ui/domain-observability.spec.md`. Browser application code SHALL NOT bypass it with raw console, logging, analytics, metrics, or tracing calls.

Performance budgets SHALL cover route JavaScript, CSS, initial data, long tasks, and task-specific latency on representative devices, networks, and data volumes. The Core Web Vitals thresholds and percentile rules in the UI performance standard are release requirements.

**Verification:** Inspect emitted events and dimensions, simulate client errors and task failures, and compare field dashboards and lab diagnostics with declared budgets.

### Requirement WEB-OBS-02: Server Telemetry and Correlation

The BFF SHALL emit structured logs, metrics, and traces with request and trace correlation. It SHALL propagate W3C trace context to the API, record sanitized route templates and upstream outcome, and export telemetry through the repository's supported OpenTelemetry/OTLP path. Raw session identifiers, authorization headers, cookies, tokens, user input, and sensitive API bodies SHALL NOT be logged or attached to telemetry.

BFF domain facts SHALL use the same probe contract and fan-out boundary. Framework-managed technical access instrumentation MAY remain an infrastructure concern, but it SHALL NOT substitute for use-case and domain-outcome probes.

Browser errors and metrics SHOULD be accepted through a same-origin BFF endpoint. Experimental browser OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation SHALL NOT be a foundational dependency; adoption requires a privacy, stability, bundle, and value assessment.

**Verification:** Follow a request from browser signal through BFF and API telemetry, trigger each failure class, and inspect exported data for correlation and prohibited values.

### Requirement WEB-API-01: UI-Supporting API Contracts

Before a feature relies on them, the HyperShell API SHALL define and test:

- a gateway connection list containing a stable identifier, display name, readiness, creation timestamp, gateway endpoint, console URL, OIDC issuer, OIDC client ID, and OIDC audience;
- gateway list, search, pagination, sort, and filter semantics, including page size (default 20, max 100), page number, search query (filters by name, ID, or fleet), sort field and direction, and response metadata (page, size, total count);
- platform:admin users SHALL receive all gateways; other users SHALL receive only gateways where they have `gateway:owner` or `gateway:viewer` bindings;
- a managed-cluster placement list containing a stable identifier, display name, provider, region, and status;
- gateway provisioning, renaming, and deletion contracts;
- gateway-scoped service-account list, create, get, revoke, and delete contracts;
- one-time service-account credential delivery, repeatable non-secret setup metadata, and browser-safe service-account capability metadata;
- authorization behavior and browser-safe capability/permission metadata;
- stable error envelopes with field errors and a support-safe operation identifier;
- idempotency or duplicate-submission behavior for consequential creates;
- optimistic concurrency through an ETag, version, or equivalent precondition contract; and
- lifecycle phase and terminal-state semantics suitable for bounded refresh.

The UI SHALL NOT infer authorization solely from object visibility, guess whether a write conflicted from timestamps, or invent terminal states not defined by the API. An authenticated event contract is required before replacing polling with SSE or WebSockets.

The API server scopes gateway visibility by per-gateway RoleBindings and the platform:admin global role -- the gateway list returns gateways where the authenticated user has a `gateway:owner` or `gateway:viewer` binding, or ALL gateways if the user has the `platform:admin` role (see [`security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md`](../security/rbac-enforcement.spec.md)). The provisioning action SHALL be available in the primary gateway experience. The gateway provisioning form SHALL NOT collect OIDC configuration -- the control plane auto-provisions Keycloak OIDC clients and populates OIDC fields when a gateway is created. Gateway provisioning requires the `gateway:creator` role (from Keycloak); the creator automatically becomes `gateway:owner` on the new gateway, which provides admin-tier access via the OIDC Role Bridge (see [`platform/openshell-gateway-keycloak.spec.md`](../platform/openshell-gateway-keycloak.spec.md)).

The gateway table SHALL identify an empty `cluster_id` as `Hub cluster` in a sortable Cluster column. The provisioning form SHALL expose the hub as `Hub cluster (default)` and list existing managed clusters as remote placement choices, without offering cluster creation or registration. Hub placement SHALL send an empty `cluster_id`; managed-cluster placement SHALL send the selected cluster identifier. The form SHALL NOT collect `fleet_id`, `release_id`, or `namespace`; it SHALL send the first two identifiers as empty strings and omit namespace because the API server owns its assignment. The gateway contract has no database field. Preview OIDC and console values MAY support design work, but production builds SHALL NOT use those placeholders as operational defaults.

**Verification:** Run API contract tests and exercise permissions, the initial globally visible gateway list, managed-cluster search and placement, provisioning, valid, empty, unchanged, conflicting, and failed renames from both entry points, confirmed and cancelled deletion from both entry points, deletion failure and duplicate submission, invalid filters, duplicate creates, stale updates, lifecycle transitions, and error mapping through the BFF and UI. Verify that rename sends only the trimmed name; hub placement sends an empty cluster identifier; managed placement sends the selected cluster identifier; the create request omits namespace; the response contains an API-assigned namespace; and the provisioning form does not expose fleet, release, or namespace fields.

## Initial Delivery Sequence

Implementation SHOULD proceed in these dependency-ordered increments:

1. Migrate the SDK to the root pnpm workspace and update repository policy checks.
2. Make the generated SDK ESM- and browser-compatible with an injectable transport.
3. Scaffold React Router SPA mode, PatternFly, localization, test tooling, and one root route.
4. Extract the canonical gateway workflows into the private gateway management UI workspace package and consume them through host adapters from the standalone console.
5. Implement the BFF session and API proxy against the selected OIDC provider.
6. Deliver the authenticated HyperShell gateway list and connection detail journey.
7. Add gateway provisioning after the local-cluster, validation, permission, concurrency, CSRF, and recovery contracts are verified.
8. Establish field telemetry, performance budgets, and the full release matrix before production availability.
