# Skills Directory & Reconciliation Checkpoint

This file is the **entrypoint** for autonomous spec-to-code reconciliation.
It describes the skill directory, holds the current gap state, and is the
checkpoint that makes `/reconcile` idempotent across sessions.

**How it works**: The `/reconcile` skill reads this file first. If the gap
table below is populated, it skips Phases 1-4 (discovery, dependency graph,
gap analysis, merge) and jumps directly to Phase 5 (wave planning) or
Phase 6 (execution). After each wave or dry-run, the agent updates this
file with the new state.

**Idempotency contract**: Running `/reconcile` with no arguments always
produces the same result for the same spec+code state.

## Gap Table

| GC-6 | Console NetworkPolicies | Present | The policy source uses the configured ingress namespace and supports both ingress controllers. | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go` | - |
| GC-7 | Console lifecycle and cleanup | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/{console.go,reconciler.go}`, `reconciler/health.go` | GC-W1 |

| GC-9 | Console address discovery | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/reconciler/reconciler.go`, `gateway/console.go` | GC-W1 |

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- The API, data model, SDKs, CLI, Keycloak client, Secret, Deployment, Service, and NetworkPolicy contracts need no change.
- GC-W1 added the OpenShift Route adapter and made provisioning, readiness, cleanup, and health repair use the selected ingress mode.
- The base controller role permits Route CRUD and create and update access to `routes/custom-host` because the console Route sets `spec.host`.

| SA-15 | Verification coverage | Present | - | `pkg/keycloak/*_test.go`, `plugins/serviceAccounts/*_test.go`, `pkg/rbac/*_test.go`, `components/cli/pkg/serviceaccount/*_test.go`, `packages/gateway-management-ui/src/service-accounts/*_test.ts*`, `components/web-console/**/*test*` | SA-W1..W6 |

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- The nested API, generated SDKs, CLI, Keycloak lifecycle, reconciliation, cleanup barrier, and gateway-detail management UI now implement the resource's public behavior.
- The SDK and CLI generators now project the nested service-account collection. Generated clients and commands remain reproducible from the OpenAPI contract.
- Keycloak 26.1 and later adds the built-in `service_account` default client scope. The control-plane convergence predicate accepts this provider-managed scope without a write and rejects all additional scopes.
- The spec forbids retrieving or regenerating a delivered client secret during reconciliation, while the full-scope drift scenario asks reconciliation to issue and inspect another Client Credentials token. Creation can perform this token test because it still holds the new secret. Later reconciliation can verify and repair structural Keycloak state but cannot perform a new grant without violating the stronger one-time-secret rule. This remains a specification mismatch; reconciliation will not fetch the secret.
- The BFF forwards `Cache-Control` and `Pragma`, preserving the one-time response's no-store policy end to end.

## Wave Plan

### KC-ES-W1: Stop the Keycloak event storm

**Scope:** OI-7, SA-14
**Dependency:** Existing control-plane token provider and service-account Keycloak reconciliation
**Status:** Complete

1. Interpret the token response's `expires_in` value as seconds and keep the 80 percent refresh threshold.
2. Add a regression test that proves that repeated calls reuse one token.
3. Accept an empty default-scope list or one built-in `service_account` scope as converged.
4. Reject every other default scope and every optional scope as drift.
5. Add regression tests for the provider-managed scope and additional-scope drift.
6. Run control-plane tests, race tests, vet, build, alignment, and review checks.

**KC-ES-W1 summary:** The token provider now interprets `expires_in` as seconds and refreshes after 80 percent of the token lifetime. Service-account reconciliation now accepts Keycloak's built-in `service_account` scope without a write and repairs every other client scope. Sequential, concurrent, threshold, no-write, drift, and update-payload tests cover the changes. The complete control-plane test suite, affected-package race tests, vet, lint, build, alignment scan, and independent review passed.

### GC-W1: OpenShift Route support for the Gateway Console

**Scope:** GC-1, GC-5, GC-7, GC-9
**Dependency:** Existing Gateway Console and Route ingress implementations
**Status:** Complete

1. Select console exposure from the effective gateway ingress mode.
2. Create an edge-terminated OpenShift Route for `openshell-console` in Route mode.
3. Observe HTTPRoute acceptance or OpenShift Route admission for address publication.
4. Reconcile initial provisioning, health repair, inactive exposure removal, and teardown for both modes.
5. Add `routes/custom-host` controller RBAC.
6. Add unit tests for resource shape, readiness, mode selection, and cleanup.
7. Run control-plane build, vet, test, alignment, and review checks.

**GC-W1 summary:** Added an edge-terminated OpenShift Route for the console, selected readiness by ingress mode, removed inactive console exposures, aligned route-enable semantics, and added custom-host RBAC. The complete control-plane test suite, affected-package race tests, vet, lint, build, Kustomize renders, alignment scan, and independent review passed.

### HYPERSHELL-49 OpenShellGatewayServiceAccount waves

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| SA-W1 | Nested REST/OpenAPI contract with separate create/get/list models and no-store one-time response | Complete |
| SA-W2 | Extend generators for nested resources and regenerate Go/TypeScript SDKs | Complete |
| SA-W3 | Persistence, nested RBAC, synchronous Keycloak adapter, lifecycle/reconciliation, cleanup, audit, deployment wiring | Complete |
| SA-W4 | HyperShell CLI create/list/get/revoke/delete and secret-safe output | Complete |
| SA-W5 | Gateway-detail Service accounts tab, host adapter, local-only handoff, setup commands, management table | Complete |
| SA-W6 | Integration verification, alignment, review-guidance audit, and checkpoint closure | Complete |

Waves execute in this order because every later consumer depends on the public contract. Specs stay frozen. Generated SDK and CLI output is regenerated from OpenAPI rather than edited by hand.

**SA-W5 summary:** Added the gateway-detail `Service accounts` tab, URL-backed collection state, server-side search/filter/sort/pagination, capability-driven creation, one-time local credential handoff, safe OpenShell and Client Credentials command generation, repeatable non-secret setup, and revoke/delete management. The BFF preserves no-store response headers.

**SA-W6 summary:** Hardened concealment, lifecycle retries, orphan cleanup, Keycloak pagination, exact role/scope replacement, expiration enforcement, and gateway endpoint normalization. Verified changed Go packages with the race detector; verified all Go modules with `go vet`; and passed the complete web formatting, lint, type, architecture, localization, unit-coverage, production-build, Storybook, and BFF checks. The repository-wide API integration run remains dependent on a correctly credentialed local PostgreSQL instance.

### Wave 1-6: COMPLETED

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| W1 | StatefulSet → Deployment + PostgreSQL Backend | ✅ Complete |
| W2 | cert-manager TLS | ✅ Complete |
| W3 | OIDC + Trusted CA Bundle | ✅ Complete |
| W4 | Gateway API Routing (GRPCRoute + BackendTLSPolicy) | ✅ Complete |
| W5 | Gateway Proto Schema + API Fields | ✅ Complete |
| W6 | Gateway Deletion + Cleanup + Route Removal | ✅ Complete |

**Wave 5 summary:** Added 5 gateway provisioning fields (image, server_dns_names, route_address, oidc, route) across proto, OpenAPI, model, migration, presenters, and gRPC/HTTP handlers. Control plane reconciler populates GatewayConfig from proto fields. (`database_config` field added in W5 was superseded by CNPG ManagedDatabase integration in W8 and has been removed.)

**Wave 6 summary:** Implemented `DeleteGatewayResources()` with label-based deletion of all namespaced resources + per-tenant ClusterRoleBinding cleanup. Added in-memory namespace cache for DELETED event handling (gRPC DELETE events have nil resource). Changed ClusterRoleBinding to per-tenant naming (`...-<namespace>`). Added `deleteGatewayAPIResources()` for route removal when routing disabled. ownerReferences deferred - explicit deletion covers the cleanup need.

### Wave 7: Cross-Cutting Fixes + Workload Restart Mechanism

**Scope:** G9, G11, G13, T5, T6, T7, O5, O7, R1, R7, R17
**Dependency:** Wave 5

1. Add `/tmp` emptyDir volume to `deployment.yaml`
2. Add `client_ca_path` to `[openshell.gateway.tls]` in `configmap.yaml`
3. Add `runAsNonRoot: true` to certgen job container SecurityContext
4. Add resource requests/limits to certgen job (cpu:50m/200m, memory:64Mi/128Mi)
5. Implement hash-annotation mechanism: compute SHA256 of ConfigMap + Secret data, annotate Deployment pod template → triggers rolling restart on config/cert changes
6. Apply `jwks_ttl` default (3600) when value is 0 in `ApplyConfigOverrides()`
7. Block gateway deployment when cert-manager is absent (not just WARN)
8. Add SAN change detection (compare ConfigMap `server_sans` to API `serverDnsNames`)
9. Fix router NetworkPolicy: use `podSelector` with gateway label; only create when `route` config present
10. ~~DNS label validation~~ Not needed: shortened namespace (26 chars) + `gw-` prefix keeps all derived names under 63 chars
11. Verify: `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`

### Wave 8: CNPG Integration + Per-Tenant Gateway API Resources + routeAddress

**Scope:** D1-D11, D-SR updates, G18, R3, R6, R9, R12, R13, R15, R16, R18
**Dependency:** Wave 5, Wave 6

**Wave 8 partial summary (d1fc36b):** CNPG operator integration complete: ManagedDatabaseReconciler (Cluster CRs), GatewayReconciler (DatabaseRole/Database/Secret CRs), ManagedDatabase deletion protection, gateway fleet/database auto-resolution, CNPG operator detection, credential rotation updated to CNPG Secret approach (no ALTER ROLE). `database_config` field removed from API, SDK, CLI (pb.go + OpenAPI models still need `make proto` + `make generate`). Items R12, R13, R15, R16, R18 (routing) and G18 remain pending.

Remaining routing items:
1. ~~Require `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAME` env var~~ R3: already Present
2. ~~GRPCRoute parentRef with sectionName~~ R9: already Present
3. Fix hostname convention: `gw-<ns>.<base-domain>` (shortened prefix)
4. Derive routeAddress deterministically from hostname, PATCH to API server via gRPC
5. Per-tenant K8s Gateway resource (R12)
6. Wildcard cert copy `grpc-gateway-certs` to tenant namespace (R13)
7. Wait for Gateway Accepted+Programmed (R16)
8. Add `kindToResource` mapping for Gateway kind (R18)
9. Verify: `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`

### Wave E2E-W1: Deploy Base/Overlay + Image Overrides ✅

**Scope:** E2E-5, E2E-7, E2E-8 | **Status:** Complete

Moved shared manifests to `deploy/base/`, created kustomize overlays for Kind and OpenShift, added IMAGE_TAG override support in `up.sh`, verified `kustomize build` for all overlays.

### Wave E2E-W2: E2E Test Framework + Kind Driver ✅

**Scope:** E2E-1, E2E-2a-e, E2E-3 | **Status:** Complete

Created `tests/e2e/lib.sh` (shared utilities), `tests/e2e/drivers/kind.sh` (5 driver functions), `tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` (infra-agnostic test adapted from `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`). Driver validation at startup with available driver listing.

### Wave E2E-W3: CI E2E Workflow ✅

**Scope:** E2E-4, E2E-5, E2E-6 | **Status:** Complete

Created `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` with PR/push/merge_group triggers, concurrency groups, component detection (api_server, control_plane, e2e, pr_test), Kind cluster creation, e2e test execution, failure-only diagnostic artifacts, 20-min timeout, summary gate. Added `e2e` component to `.github/component-paths.json`.

### Wave R1-R8: RBAC COMPLETED

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| WR1 | Data Model Foundation (users, roles, roleBindings plugins, 6 built-in roles) | ✅ Complete |
| WR2 | API Surface (handlers, presenters, routes for roles + roleBindings) | ✅ Complete |
| WR3 | User Auto-Provisioning + Fleet Bootstrap (middleware + fleet:owner binding) | ✅ Complete |
| WR4 | Authorization Middleware (scope-aware evaluation, exempt endpoints, enforcement flag) | ✅ Complete |
| WR6 | gRPC Authorization (unary + stream interceptors with lazy init) | ✅ Complete |
| WR7 | Integration Tests (roles: 4 tests, roleBindings: 7 tests) | ✅ Complete |
| WR8 | Security Hardening (12 PR review findings resolved) | ✅ Complete |

**Wave R1 summary:** Created `plugins/users/`, `plugins/roles/`, `plugins/roleBindings/` plugins with models, migrations, DAOs, services. Seeded 6 built-in roles with permissions JSONB and hierarchy levels (0=platform:admin, 1=fleet:owner, 2=fleet:editor/platform:viewer, 3=fleet:viewer/gateway:viewer).

**Wave R2 summary:** Added OpenAPI specs (`openapi.roles.yaml`, `openapi.role_bindings.yaml`), handlers (roles: read-only List/Get; roleBindings: Create/List/Get/Delete), presenters, route registration. Updated openapi_embed_test.go operation count from 31 to 37.

**Wave R3 summary:** `UserProvisioningMiddleware` upserts User from JWT claims (username, email, name) on every authenticated request. `fleetBootstrapper.CreateOwnerBinding` creates fleet:owner RoleBinding atomically in same DB transaction as fleet creation. Central `plugins/rbac/plugin.go` wires middleware on apiV1Router.

**Wave R4 summary:** `rbacAuthzMiddleware` implements `auth.AuthorizationMiddleware` with scope-aware evaluation: loads caller's RoleBindings via `FindBindingsByUserID`, matches against resource scope extracted from URL. Exempt endpoints: POST /fleets, GET /metadata, GET /openapi. Service caller bypass via ClientID detection. Error opacity: 404 for unauthorized singleton GETs, 403 for mutations. `RBAC_ENFORCE=true` env var controls enforcement.

**Wave R6 summary:** `RBACUnaryInterceptor` and `RBACStreamInterceptor` apply same scope-aware evaluation to gRPC calls. `lazyRBACInterceptor` with `sync.Once` resolves services on first call (registered at init time via `RegisterPostAuthGRPC*Interceptor`). `provisionUserForGRPC` extracts JWT payload and provisions user before authorization.

**Wave R7 summary:** Integration tests for roles (TestRoleListReturnsBuiltInRoles, TestRoleGetById, TestRoleGetNotFound, TestRoleListUnauthenticated) and roleBindings (TestRoleList, TestRoleGet, TestRoleBindingCreate, TestRoleBindingDelete, TestRoleBindingList, TestRoleBindingScopeValidation, TestFleetCreationCreatesOwnerBinding).

**Wave R8 summary:** Resolved 12 PR review security findings. Blockers: (1) gRPC interceptor now evaluates bindings against method type via `isGRPCAuthorized` instead of blanket pass-through; (2) RoleBinding Create enforces strictly-below hierarchy with platform:admin exception via `validateHierarchy`. Majors: (3) `matchesFleetRole` fixed `fleet:editor` DELETE bug (`|| true` removed); (4) gateway-scoped bindings now compare `b.GatewayID` against request `gatewayID`; (5) `isExemptEndpoint` now exempts GET /roles and GET /roles/{id}; (6) gateway scope validation rejects `fleet_id` (exactly one FK); (7) last-owner protection uses `NewNonBlockingLock` advisory lock to prevent races. Verified: fleet owner bootstrap IS atomic via framework `TransactionMiddleware`. Added 24 unit tests (`pkg/rbac/`) + 5 new integration tests. All admin seeding references removed from spec and RECONCILE.md.

### Wave KC-W1: Keycloak Client Provisioning + OIDC Auto-Population ✅

**Scope:** KC-1, KC-2, KC-3, KC-4, KC-6, KC-8, KC-9 | **Status:** Complete

Created `keycloak/client.go` with full Admin REST API client (token cache with 80% TTL refresh, client CRUD, role/mapper provisioning, atomic rollback). Read `hypershell-keycloak-admin` Secret at CP startup. `reconcileKeycloakClient()` provisions OIDC client with PKCE, fullScopeAllowed=false, openshell-admin/openshell-user roles, audience/sub/client-roles mappers. Auto-populates Gateway `oidc` field via `UpdateOIDC` callback. Keycloak client deleted on Gateway deletion. OpenAPI `oidc` field marked `readOnly: true`.

### Wave KC-W2: OIDC Role Bridge (RoleBinding Event Handling) ✅

**Scope:** KC-5, RBAC-7 | **Status:** Complete

Added `role_bindings.proto` with `WatchRoleBindings` RPC. Created `grpc_handler.go` and `grpc_presenter.go` in roleBindings plugin with role name enrichment via RoleService. Added `WatchRoleBindings` to watcher package. Created `RoleBindingReconciler` that maps gateway:owner→openshell-admin, gateway:viewer→openshell-user and calls `keycloak.AssignClientRole`/`RemoveClientRole`. 7th watch stream launched conditionally when Keycloak is configured. Added `GetUnscoped` to DAO/service for soft-deleted event handling.

### Wave KC-W3: Gateway Visibility Scoping (Per-Query DAO Filtering) ✅

**Scope:** KC-7, RBAC-2 (list filtering) | **Status:** Complete

Added `FindGatewayIDsByUserID` DAO method (distinct gateway_id from role_bindings). Created `GatewayVisibilityFilter` interface and `rbac.NewGatewayVisibilityFilter` adapter. Gateway List handler filters results by accessible gateway IDs when user is authenticated. Singleton GET returns 404 for unauthorized gateways (unchanged, already in RBAC middleware).

### Wave SR-W1: Database Password Rotation ✅

**Scope:** SR-1, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-8 | **Status:** Complete

Added `database/sql` + `lib/pq` to control plane. `rotateDatabaseCredentials()` checks `rotate-db-credentials` annotation vs `last-db-rotation` on Secret; generates 32-byte hex password via crypto/rand; connects to PostgreSQL and executes `ALTER ROLE`; updates Secret with new password+URL; sets `last-db-rotation` annotation. ALTER ROLE before Secret update for safety. `applyConfigHashAnnotation` now includes `openshell-gateway-db-credentials` Secret. Wired into `ReconcileGateway` after `reconcileDatabaseCredentials()`.

### Wave NGC + S1-S4: Namespace GC + Event-Driven Sandbox Count ✅

**Scope:** NGC-1..NGC-6, SC-1..SC-6 | **Status:** Complete

**Namespace GC (NGC):** `NamespaceGCReconciler` sweeps managed namespaces (both
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=hypershell-control-plane` and
`hypershell.redhat.io/managed=true` required) and reaps those orphaned past the
grace period. Grace timer persisted on the `hypershell.redhat.io/gc-eligible-since`
annotation (RFC3339) and cleared when a Gateway reappears. Sweep aborts entirely
if Gateways cannot be listed, so a transient API failure never reaps a live
namespace. A `GarbageCollected` Event is recorded in the control-plane namespace
before deletion. Env-configurable (`GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_ENABLED`/`_INTERVAL`/
`_GRACE_PERIOD`, defaults true/5m/10m). Delete-driven cleanup deletes the
namespace (cascading in-namespace resources incl. sandbox pods) and explicitly
reaps out-of-namespace state (ClusterRoleBinding, Keycloak client, cross-namespace
credential RBAC).

**Sandbox Count (S1-S4):** Migrated active-sandbox accounting from a periodic
full-namespace pod LIST (previously in the health reconciler) to an event-driven
label-selected pod informer.
- **S1:** `AdjustActiveSandboxCount(namespace, delta)` and
  `SetActiveSandboxCount(namespace, count)` gRPC RPCs with atomic single-column
  SQL, floored at zero, NULL-as-zero, `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard. `active_sandbox_count`
  made a nullable `*int` column, OpenAPI `readOnly`, excluded from patch.
- **S2:** `SandboxCountReconciler`: informer on `agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash`;
  increments/decrements on active-set transitions; `synced` gate suppresses the
  initial-LIST add burst; periodic `selfHeal` sets the absolute count from the cache
  for every gateway namespace (drift-to-zero + post-restart recovery). Legacy
  `openshell.ai/managed-by=openshell` sandbox label dropped from code and spec.
  Health reconciler's sandbox-counting block removed. Full unit-test suite
  (`sandboxcount_test.go`) incl. a `-race` concurrency test.
- **S3:** Non-sortable "Active sandboxes" console column adjacent to the gateway
  name; unset renders the localized not-available fallback (NULL→N/A, 0→"0").
  New reusable-package message re-extracted into web-console's `en.json`.
- **S4:** Verified: control-plane `go build`/`vet`/`test -race` clean, golangci-lint
  0 issues (control-plane + api-server gateways plugin), reusable UI package and
  web-console `check` green. (api-server unit tests run on CI; the local
  Apple-Silicon go-m1cpu cgo crash at package init is environmental.)

### Future (Deferred)

| # | Item | Domain | Reason |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| RBAC-5 | Platform Admin Bootstrap | Security | First admin created via DB migration; no CLI by design |
| G2 | Shared Kustomize Library + CLI | Gateway | Architectural; needs design |
| G17 | SSH Payload Delivery | Gateway | New feature; needs design |
| D13 | Database Field Immutability | DB | API server validation |
| D14 | Gateway Deletion Protection | DB | API server validation |
| D12 | DROP COLUMN migration for `database_config` | DB | Column still in DB schema; destructive migration deferred |
| O6 | Custom raw TOML `config` field | OIDC | Advanced; not blocking |
| SR-5 | KEK Rotation | Secret Rotation | Requires gateway re-encryption API (Day-2) |
| SR-7 | Provider Credential Rotation | Secret Rotation | Platform-managed (K8s SA, Vault); no CP action needed |
| DM-4 | Gateway `status` writeback | Data Model | Depends on CP-4 |
| lib/pq dead dep | `lib/pq` in go.mod but not imported | CP | Run `go mod tidy` in control-plane to remove dead dependency |
| DM-5 | Canary release logic | Data Model | GatewayReleaseReconciler is stub |
| DM-6 | Network mesh logic | Data Model | GatewayNetworkReconciler is stub |
| CP-4 | Status synchronization / health checks | CP | Needs periodic reconcile loop |
| CP-5 | Multi-cluster client pool | CP | Architecture: per-cluster kubeconfig |
| LD-* | Local development (most items) | Local Dev | Spec recently authored; MVP first |
| WEB-AUTH-* | OIDC BFF + session + CSRF | Web Console | Implemented in OIDC wave; 3 minor follow-ups remain |

### Cross-Cutting Findings

1. **Stale `statefulset.yaml`**: `manifests/gateway/statefulset.yaml` exists but is unreferenced (uses SQLite). Should be removed.
2. **Naming: Sector vs Fleet**: Spec now uses "Fleet" (aligned with code). No longer a gap.
3. **No restart mechanism (cross-spec)**: TLS, OIDC, and Routing specs all require workload restart on config changes. Addressed in Wave 7 via hash annotation.
4. **Label-based cleanup (cross-spec)**: Database and Routing specs updated to use `hypershell.redhat.io/managed` label-based deletion instead of ownerReferences. ownerReferences were infeasible (DB resources created before Deployment) and unnecessary given explicit cleanup in `DeleteGatewayResources()`.
5. ~~**Config-hash missing DB credentials**~~: Resolved in SR-W1. `applyConfigHashAnnotation` now includes `openshell-gateway-db-credentials` Secret.
6. ~~**RoleBinding watcher missing**~~: Resolved in KC-W2. CP now watches 7 resource types (added RoleBindings via `WatchRoleBindings` gRPC stream).

Updated 7 docs: `skills/deploy/ibm-cluster/SKILL.md` (image refs, path, namespace, image-var explanation), `skills/deploy/gcp-cluster/SKILL.md` (path fix, RBAC ref), `skills/deploy/deploy-cluster/SKILL.md` (full rewrite: Keycloak bootstrap, `hypershell-api-config` Secret creation, CNPG database, OIDC/JWT security, troubleshooting for missing Secret), `skills/tooling/update-openshell/SKILL.md` (grep patterns for new image names, search path fixes), `skills/RECONCILE.md` (skill directory tree, this log entry), `README.md` (env var rows, namespace refs), `specs/platform/openshift-development.spec.md` (deploy/ directory layout, overlay limitations note). Overlay gaps surfaced: `deploy/openshift/` requires manually-created `hypershell-api-config` Secret (missing from repo; documented in deploy-cluster), hardcoded domain placeholder, missing Keycloak Route on OpenShift. Marked as known limitations in specs. |
