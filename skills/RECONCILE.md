# Skills Directory & Reconciliation Checkpoint

This file is the **entrypoint** for autonomous spec-to-code reconciliation.
It describes the skill directory, holds the current gap state, and is the
checkpoint that makes `/reconcile` idempotent across sessions.

**How it works**: The `/reconcile` skill reads this file first. If the gap
table below is populated, it skips Phases 1-4 (discovery, dependency graph,
gap analysis, merge) and jumps directly to Phase 5 (wave planning) or
Phase 6 (execution). After each wave or dry-run, the agent updates this
file with the new state.

**Idempotency contract**: Running `/reconcile` with no arguments always
produces the same result for the same spec+code state.

## Reconciliation State

**Last analyzed**: 2026-09-22 (scoped reanalysis for commits since `464ec5e`: updated codebase commit to `5e14f29b` (external-db-only-redo HEAD: remove ManagedDatabase API); registered 6 new spec files (gateway-provision-outcomes, gateway-release-distribution, gateway-fleet-total-trend, gateway-sandbox-active-trends, hub-cluster-utilization-trends, openshell-branch-build); updated E2E-9 for 3-mode E2E_MODE split (#332); added E2E-13 for macOS CLI container wrapper (#335); added DM-3g/h/i for new Gateway schema fields; added OS-14/OS-15 for openshift-seed and openshift-test requirements; full-corpus recount pending for new specs). Prior 2026-09-16 (scoped reanalysis + execution of specs/platform/ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md for HYPERSHELL-240 after the spec moved from continuous-deploy-for-life-of-PR to ephemeral-by-default with `/pr-extend` / `/pr-destroy`; D-E2E-OIDC closed as Present via PR-ENV-10; the last full-corpus analysis remains 2026-08-31). Prior 2026-09-14 scoped analysis of specs/platform/gateway-deletion-finalization.spec.md for HYPERSHELL-182; closed the no-silent-orphan gap G1: best-effort deletion failures for gateway-owned resources with no automatic recovery path -- leaked ClusterRoleBinding, leaked Keycloak gateway/console clients, and Keycloak clients skipped when the stored identity is unresolvable or the provisioner is deconfigured -- now emit a durable IncompleteFinalization Warning Event in the control-plane namespace instead of only logging; in-namespace sweep G2 already satisfied. Prior 2026-09-09 scoped reanalysis of e2e-testing.spec.md + local-development.spec.md against HEAD `21f02a0` for the new OpenShift E2E CI content added by the HYPERSHELL-240 docs commit: OpenShift driver unification #232/#244, dynamic namespace-GC timing, and the merge-queue Kind CI gate are all implemented; D-E2E-OIDC was then still listed as a divergence pending HYPERSHELL-240 (closed 2026-09-16). Prior 2026-09-04 scoped reanalysis of the CP-OBS-07 reconcile-queue metric changes after review; operational-dashboard through OP-DASH-20; OP-DASH-18 NaN fallback; OP-DASH-19 independent metric sources + partial failure; OP-DASH-20 section titles + header refresh consolidation; cluster memory/cpu/pods/nodes metrics; gateway-provision-time GPT-W1; registered-users complete; the last full-corpus analysis remains 2026-08-31)
**Spec corpus**: 55 spec files; the coverage table tracks 45 analyzed feature/spec groups after adding Gateway Provision Outcomes, Gateway Release Distribution, Gateway Fleet Total Trend, Gateway Sandbox Active Trends, Hub Cluster Utilization Trends, and OpenShell Branch Build (6 new specs from commits `85927b3c`/`be0bf2ea`/`630a5ed1`; full per-requirement analysis pending for each)
**Codebase commit**: `5e14f29b` (feat: remove ManagedDatabase API; provision gateway DBs from admin Secret)

## Gap Table

### generated-gateway-config-validation.spec.md (HYPERSHELL-179)

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| CGV-1 | Validate the rendered configuration before rollout | Present | Render the gateway.toml artifact and validate well-formedness + OIDC structural coherence, distinct from the input-field check | `components/control-plane/internal/gateway/manifests.go` (`RenderGatewayConfigTOML`), `internal/gateway/validation.go` (`ValidateRenderedGatewayConfig`) | CGV-W1 |
| CGV-2 | A validation failure blocks rollout without disrupting a running gateway | Present | Gate placed before `deployGateway`, so no ConfigMap is written and the workload is never rolled onto an invalid artifact | `components/control-plane/internal/gateway/reconciler.go` (`ReconcileGateway`) | CGV-W1 |
| CGV-3 | Validation failures are observable (`Failed` + reason + log) | Present | Typed `RenderedConfigValidationError` surfaces `PhaseFailed` with a human-readable reason and a name+namespace log line | `components/control-plane/internal/reconciler/reconciler.go`, `internal/gateway/validation.go` | CGV-W1 |
| CGV-4 | Validation is idempotent and self-correcting | Present | Up-front gate leaves no partial artifacts; a corrected config renders valid and rolls out on the next reconcile | `components/control-plane/internal/gateway/reconciler.go` | CGV-W1 |

**Scoped coverage:** 4 of 4 requirements present. Reuses the canonical `Failed` phase (no new vocabulary). This scoped run does not change the full-corpus coverage table.

**Direction checks:**

- Spec to code: rendered-artifact validation, up-front gating, `Failed`+reason observability, and idempotency are all implemented.
- Code to spec: the new TOML-parse + OIDC-coherence check is confined to the generated artifact; input validation (`ValidateGatewayConfig`) is unchanged.
- OpenAPI to spec: no public API field or route added; validation is control-plane-internal and reuses the existing `phase`/`status` fields.

### control-plane-observability.spec.md (CP-OBS-07 reconcile-queue metric delta)

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| CP-OBS-07f | Export ready reconcile-queue depth as an observable gauge with unit `{item}` | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go`, `components/control-plane/internal/watcher/requeue.go` | CP-OBS-RQ-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07g | Export ready-to-worker queue wait as a histogram in seconds | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go`, `components/control-plane/internal/watcher/requeue.go` | CP-OBS-RQ-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07h | Use only the bounded `resource.kind` attribute and no resource identifier | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go`, `metrics_test.go` | CP-OBS-RQ-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07i | Record one wait observation for coalesced work when `Handle` starts | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/watcher/requeue.go`, `requeue_test.go` | CP-OBS-RQ-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07j | Exclude scheduled retry backoff from queue depth and queue wait | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/watcher/requeue.go`, `requeue_test.go` | CP-OBS-RQ-W1 |

**Scoped coverage:** 5 of 5 changed CP-OBS-07 fields are present. This scoped run does not change the full-corpus coverage table.

**Direction checks:**

- Spec to code: The two instruments, bounded label, coalescing rule, and backoff rule are present.
- Code to spec: All new queue telemetry behavior is in CP-OBS-07. Explicit histogram buckets are an implementation detail.
- OpenAPI to spec: The metrics do not add a public API field or route.

### control-plane-observability.spec.md (CP-OBS-07 Gateway provision-duration delta)

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| CP-OBS-07a | Export `gateway.provision.duration` as a histogram in seconds, with explicit buckets from 1 second through 15 minutes | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go`, `metrics_test.go` | CP-OBS-GPD-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07b | Use the stored Gateway `created_at` and `updated_at` values, and ignore missing, invalid, or reversed values | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/reconciler/metrics.go`, `metrics_test.go`; `components/api-server/plugins/gateways/grpc_presenter.go` | CP-OBS-GPD-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07c | Record only after a successful direct update to `Running` | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/reconciler/reconciler.go` | CP-OBS-GPD-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07d | Record a delayed `Provisioning` to `Running` transition, but do not record a `Degraded` to `Running` recovery | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/reconciler/health.go`, `metrics.go`, `gateway_vocabulary.go`; `components/control-plane/internal/watcher/watcher.go` | CP-OBS-GPD-W1 |
| CP-OBS-07e | Record at most one observation for one Gateway and do not export a Gateway identifier as a metric attribute | Present | - | `components/control-plane/internal/reconciler/metrics.go`, `metrics_test.go`; `components/control-plane/internal/otel/metrics_test.go` | CP-OBS-GPD-W1 |

**Scoped coverage:** 5 of 5 changed CP-OBS-07 fields are present. This scoped run does not change the full-corpus coverage table.

**Direction checks:**

- Spec to code: The metric contract, both promotion paths, timestamp rules, recovery rule, single-observation rule, and attribute rule are present.
- Code to spec: All new provision-duration behavior is in CP-OBS-07. The exact intermediate bucket values are implementation details inside the specified range.
- OpenAPI to spec: The metric does not add a public API field. The existing `ObjectReference` contract supplies `created_at` and `updated_at`, and the gRPC presenter returns both fields after an update.

The first gap analysis found a race between the event-driven reconciler and the health reconciler. Both paths could record the first `Running` transition. CP-OBS-GPD-W1 adds one process-wide claim per Gateway. The delete path removes the claim. A normal reconcile uses the stored phase before work starts. A forced retry keeps the phase that existed before the retry bypass. These checks prevent work on a `Running` or `Degraded` Gateway from producing a new observation.

### openshell-gateway-console.spec.md

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| GC-1 | Console enablement follows the selected ingress mode | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/{reconciler.go,console.go}`, `reconciler/health.go` | GC-W1 |
| GC-2 | Confidential console Keycloak client | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/keycloak/client.go`, `gateway/console.go` | - |
| GC-3 | Stable console credential Secret | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go` | - |
| GC-4 | Console Deployment | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go` | - |
| GC-5 | Service and mode-selected HTTP exposure | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go`, `deploy/base/controller-rbac.yaml` | GC-W1 |
| GC-6 | Console NetworkPolicies | Present | The policy source uses the configured ingress namespace and supports both ingress controllers. | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go` | - |
| GC-7 | Console lifecycle and cleanup | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/{console.go,reconciler.go}`, `reconciler/health.go` | GC-W1 |
| GC-8 | Provisioning atomicity and idempotency | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/gateway/console.go`, `internal/keycloak/client.go` | - |
| GC-9 | Console address discovery | Present | - | `control-plane/internal/reconciler/reconciler.go`, `gateway/console.go` | GC-W1 |

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- The API, data model, SDKs, CLI, Keycloak client, Secret, Deployment, Service, and NetworkPolicy contracts need no change.
- GC-W1 added the OpenShift Route adapter and made provisioning, readiness, cleanup, and health repair use the selected ingress mode.
- The base controller role permits Route CRUD and create and update access to `routes/custom-host` because the console Route sets `spec.host`.

### openshift-development.spec.md (local-dev lifecycle)

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| OS-1 | Cluster Lifecycle Driver Abstraction | Present | Kind targets keep current behavior via a thin wrapper around `scripts/kind/` | `scripts/cluster/`, `Makefile` | OS-W2 |
| OS-2 | OpenShift Lifecycle Up and Down | Present | `make openshift-up` / `openshift-down` / `openshift-status`. `openshift-teardown` is an alias of down (no cluster to destroy). Down deletes the platform project and `${name}-keycloak`. | `scripts/cluster/drivers/openshift.sh` | OS-W2 |
| OS-3 | Ephemeral Namespace Isolation | Present | Current `oc project -q` by default; `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` overrides. Unlabeled existing projects are the developer's chosen target (no prompt; namespace labeling is best-effort). Refuse other HyperShell env ids and reserved names. Down tries `oc delete project` for the platform and `-keycloak` projects; if forbidden, deletes HyperShell resources (including unlabeled Keycloak) in both. Labels are not a delete gate. | `scripts/cluster/lib.sh`, `drivers/openshift.sh` | OS-W2 |
| OS-4 | Keycloak Namespace | Present | `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak` via `oc new-project`; apply while that project is selected, then switch back; OIDC issuer from Keycloak Route; `KC_HOSTNAME` is host-only; `keycloak-allow-platform` NetworkPolicy lets platform pods reach JWKS/Admin API; console redirect URIs and API seeding use host `curl` against Routes (API server image has no curl) | `rewrite-namespaces.py`, `drivers/openshift.sh`, `deploy/openshift/keycloak-networkpolicy.yaml` | OS-W2 |
| OS-5 | Component Swap on OpenShift | Present | Build, push immutable commit+namespace identity, per-namespace `.openshift-swaps/`, reconcile preserves swaps | `drivers/openshift.sh`, `Makefile` | OS-W2 |
| OS-E2E-1 | OpenShift E2E Driver | Partial | Manual `make e2e` / `make e2e-performance` against a pre-deployed cluster. Out of scope for OS-W2. | `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh` | OS-W1 |
| OS-7 | E2E Script Consolidation | Missing | Intentionally deferred: not local-dev lifecycle | `components/pr-test/` | Future |
| OS-8 | Ephemeral CI Environment Provisioning | Missing | Intentionally deferred: not local-dev lifecycle | - | Future |
| OS-9 | Environment Access Handoff | Missing | Intentionally deferred: CI-only | - | Future |
| OS-10 | Blessed OpenShift Overlay | Partial | Namespace parameterization, Routes, SCC RoleBindings; `API_ENV=development_oidc` in the overlay (not `oc set env`); gateway base domain discovered from the shared Gateway listener (not `GATEWAY_API_BASE_DOMAIN`). Drift-check CI job deferred. | `deploy/openshift/`, `rewrite-namespaces.py` | OS-W2 |
| OS-11 | OpenShift CI Workflow Shape | Missing | Intentionally deferred: not local-dev lifecycle | - | Future |
| OS-12 | Cluster Infrastructure Prerequisites | Present | `make openshift-up` fails fast when the shared Gateway is missing or not Programmed. GatewayClass is cluster-scoped and not GET-checked (developers typically cannot read it). | `drivers/openshift.sh` `check_infrastructure` | OS-W2 |
| OS-13 | Cluster-Scoped Permissions + SCC/RBAC posture | Present | Default applies prefixed overlay ClusterRole then ClusterRoleBinding. If ClusterRole create is Forbidden, bind the prefixed CRB to existing ClusterRole `hypershell-controller` (replace immutable roleRef if needed). Never touches unprefixed `hypershell-controller`. Down deletes this env's prefixed ClusterRole/CRB. | `rewrite-namespaces.py`, `drivers/openshift.sh` `apply_cluster_rbac`, `deploy/base/controller-rbac.yaml` | OS-W2 |
| OS-14 | Standalone Seed Command (`make openshift-seed`) | Missing | Seeds domain resources into an existing environment without re-applying the overlay; stops when environment is absent; always seeds (ignores `SKIP_SEED`); honors `SEED_STRICT`; idempotent | - | Future |
| OS-15 | Lifecycle Library Unit Tests (`make openshift-test`) | Missing | No-cluster unit/static harness covering pure helpers, namespace rewriter, and source-level safety invariants (teardown==down, never delete unprefixed `hypershell-controller` RBAC, swaps never use internal registry) | - | Future |

Local-dev lifecycle (`make openshift-up` / `down` / component swaps) is implemented. E2E driver completion beyond the OS-W1 manual slice, legacy `pr-test` consolidation, ephemeral CI, access handoff, overlay drift CI, and the OpenShift e2e workflow remain out of scope for this wave.

### openshell-gateway-service-accounts.spec.md

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| SA-1 | Synchronous provisioning and one-time delivery | Present | - | `plugins/serviceAccounts/`, `pkg/keycloak/service_accounts.go` | SA-W1..W3 |

| SA-12 | Scopes are not configurable in version 1 | Present | - | `openapi.serviceAccounts.yaml`, `pkg/keycloak/service_accounts.go` | SA-W1, W3 |
| SA-13 | Auditability and secret redaction | Present | - | `plugins/serviceAccounts/`, `pkg/keycloak/`, generated SDKs, `components/web-console/bff/`, `packages/gateway-management-ui/src/service-accounts/` | SA-W3, W5 |
| SA-14 | Reconciliation and drift repair | Present | The control-plane convergence predicate accepts Keycloak's built-in `service_account` scope and rejects all other client scopes. Structural reconciliation intentionally does not fetch a delivered secret or mint a token; this follows the stronger secret rule and records the spec contradiction. | `components/control-plane/internal/serviceaccountkeycloak/client.go`, `plugins/serviceAccounts/service.go`, `pkg/keycloak/service_accounts.go` | KC-ES-W1 |
| SA-15 | Verification coverage | Present | - | `pkg/keycloak/*_test.go`, `plugins/serviceAccounts/*_test.go`, `pkg/rbac/*_test.go`, `components/cli/pkg/serviceaccount/*_test.go`, `packages/gateway-management-ui/src/service-accounts/*_test.ts*`, `components/web-console/**/*test*` | SA-W1..W6 |

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- The nested API, generated SDKs, CLI, Keycloak lifecycle, reconciliation, cleanup barrier, and gateway-detail management UI now implement the resource's public behavior.
- The SDK and CLI generators now project the nested service-account collection. Generated clients and commands remain reproducible from the OpenAPI contract.
- Keycloak 26.1 and later adds the built-in `service_account` default client scope. The control-plane convergence predicate accepts this provider-managed scope without a write and rejects all additional scopes.
- The spec forbids retrieving or regenerating a delivered client secret during reconciliation, while the full-scope drift scenario asks reconciliation to issue and inspect another Client Credentials token. Creation can perform this token test because it still holds the new secret. Later reconciliation can verify and repair structural Keycloak state but cannot perform a new grant without violating the stronger one-time-secret rule. This remains a specification mismatch; reconciliation will not fetch the secret.
- The BFF forwards `Cache-Control` and `Pragma`, preserving the one-time response's no-store policy end to end.

### openshell-gateway-database.spec.md

> Re-baselined 2026-09-16 (branch `external-db-only`): the ManagedDatabase resource, Gateway `database_id`, database placement and the `hypershell-managed-db-*` credentials namespaces were removed. The controller now reads one mounted admin Secret (`hypershell-gateway-database-admin`, `GATEWAY_DATABASE_ADMIN_DIR`) and always connects with `sslmode=verify-full`. Rows D1-D14 below replace the earlier W8 rows; the W8 wave log further down is historical and is left as written.
>
> Updated 2026-09-18: upstream's Helm chart adoption (PR #194) left the gateway
> workload with no mechanism to mount a CA bundle for its database connection
> (unlike its OIDC and Vault CA support). The tenant/gateway leg was downgraded to
> `sslmode=require` (encrypted, not certificate-verified); only the admin
> connection remains `verify-full`. Rows D4-D6 and D10 below reflect this.

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- Prometheus pipeline and `GatewayMetricsDashboard` are implemented on branch `ui-and-data`. `/dashboard` renders `OperationalDashboardPage` per `web-console/operational-dashboard.spec.md`; the metrics component is embeddable but not mounted on that route by design.
- DASH-07 was narrowed in the spec amendment: sidebar navigation and `GatewayMetricsDashboard` at `/dashboard` are no longer required.

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- Live gateway and sandbox metrics load via RBAC-scoped REST list pagination, not the Prometheus BFF route. This matches the spec's relationship table vs `gateway-metrics-dashboard.spec.md`.
- `dashboard.layout.template.invalid` probe name is declared but never published; invalid saved templates silently fall back to default (acceptable for v1; no gap recorded).
- CI registers `packages/operational-dashboard-ui` with `pnpm check` in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`.
- OP-DASH-16 (2026-08-31): shared `StatusDonutChart` stack; `nodes` widget at `NODE_STATUS_WIDGET_HEIGHT`; layout persistence key `hypershell.operational-dashboard.layout.v17`.
- OP-DASH-17 (2026-08-31): `pods` widget uses `PodCapacityChart` (phase segments + gray Unused); BFF phase PromQL; layout persistence key `hypershell.operational-dashboard.layout.v18`.
- Post-OP-DASH-17 polish (2026-08-31): system-summary failed pod count; taller system-summary widget; expanded compact donut for pods subtitle; Storybook mock aligned to production adapter; layout persistence key `hypershell.operational-dashboard.layout.v19`.
- OP-DASH-20 (2026-09-02): `section-title` widget for platform adoption and hub cluster headers; full-width title rows; headerless/borderless presentation; layout persistence key `hypershell.operational-dashboard.layout.v23`; `sanitizeDashboardTemplate` preserves multiple `section-title` instances; page header consolidates refresh, reset, and add-widgets controls (no separate toolbar).
- Post-connect polish (2026-09-02, `06d6c56`): removed interim `usesSampleData` info banner and i18n keys; all OP-DASH-08 metrics are connected so the banner is no longer required.
- OP-W2 (2026-09-03): partial metric-source failure handling - adapter fetches sources independently, page shows warning + metric-unavailable per widget/summary row, refresh merges stale data for failed sources (`dashboard-metric-sources.ts`, `get-metrics-data.ts` `keepPreviousData`).

### gateway-provision-outcomes.spec.md (HYPERSHELL-280)

> Added 2026-09-17 (`85927b3c`). Full per-requirement analysis pending. Code delivered in the same commit: `bff/src/metrics-gateway-provision-outcomes.ts` (BFF PromQL counter proxy, rolling 24-hour window), `packages/operational-dashboard-ui/src/dashboard/provision-reliability-*.ts(x)` (adapter + chart), `control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go` (counter instrument), `reconciler/metrics.go` (outcome recording on first terminal transition). The spec defines ~10 requirements (GPO-00..GPO-09). Scoped assessment: all code-side requirements appear present; the BFF/adapter/CP implementation mirrors what the spec describes.

| # | Requirement | Status | Gap | Code Location | Wave |
|---|-------------|--------|-----|---------------|------|
| GPO-00 | Prometheus counter availability (`gateway_provision_outcomes_total`) | Partial | Requires OTLP-to-Prometheus wiring in deploy/kind (same as GPT-00) | `control-plane/internal/otel/metrics.go` | GPT-W2 |

**Scoped analysis notes:** GPO-00 (Prometheus availability) shares the same deploy/kind OTLP wiring gap as GPT-00; both are planned under GPT-W2.

### gateway-release-distribution.spec.md (HYPERSHELL-280)

> Added 2026-09-17 (`85927b3c`). Full per-requirement analysis pending. Code delivered in the same commit: `web-console/app/adapters/api/gateway-release-distribution-aggregation.ts` (paginated gateway+release list aggregation), `operational-dashboard-ui/src/dashboard/gateway-releases-chart.tsx`, `dashboard-control-plane.ts` (release-distribution adapter), `pkg/rbac/authorization.go` (fleet-wide list for dashboard-operator role).

| GPT-07 | Refresh and error semantics | Partial | Omit-on-failure works; zero-count path still list-based | `dashboard-control-plane.ts` | GPT-W2 |
| GPT-08 | Verification | Partial | List-based adapter tests only | `dashboard-control-plane.test.ts` | GPT-W2 |

**Scoped analysis notes:**

- **Spec v2 (2026-09-03):** Retires gateway-list timestamp proxy. Provision time becomes fleet-wide histogram stats via BFF Prometheus proxy (same pattern as cluster memory).
- **Drift:** GPT-W1 implementation (mean from gateway list) remains until GPT-W2 lands.
- **Prerequisite:** Deploy/kind must expose `gateway_provision_duration_seconds` to the BFF's `PROMETHEUS_URL` (GPT-00).

The OpenShift e2e driver (`tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh`) now exists and is unified with the Kind driver (#232/#244): it shares the token/role helpers, discovers the API/console via Routes, derives the gateway base domain from the shared Gateway listener, and overrides only where OpenShift constructs differ. Dynamic namespace-GC timing (`configure_namespace_gc_timing` / `restore_namespace_gc_timing`) and the merge-queue Kind CI gate (`merge_group` trigger, dedicated `.tekton/*-merge-queue.yaml`, browser-trace skip) are implemented. `make e2e` / `make e2e-performance` honor `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER=openshift`.

The OpenShift e2e driver's `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials` path (D-E2E-OIDC) is implemented and tracked as PR-ENV-10 (Present).

Kind/local/stage have no Secret, so the IdP stays off. **Org-gate enforcement (weaker, no custom Keycloak image):** the web-console BFF checks org membership / allowlist after the OIDC callback (`GITHUB_ORG_GATE` / `GITHUB_USERNAME_ALLOWLIST`, copied from the Secret by `openshift-up`). Denied users get no HyperShell session, so the BFF never forwards an API bearer. The API server is not separately org-gated. Unit-tested. | `deploy/base/keycloak/keycloak.yaml`, `components/web-console/bff/src/github-org-gate.ts`, `components/web-console/bff/src/auth.ts`, `scripts/cluster/drivers/openshift.sh`, `.github/actions/deploy-pr-environment/action.yml` | W2 ✅ |
| PR-ENV-9 | Admin roles + developer-tier impersonation (seeded dev principal) | Present | Base realm grants `platform:admin`+`gateway:creator` on GitHub broker login; seeded `developer` user holds neither (hypershell-users only). `hypershell-e2e` has realm-management impersonation + token exchange so CI and an admin can impersonate that principal.

**Human-provisioned prerequisites (not code):** GitHub OAuth App (client id/secret) + one stable callback URL, CI cluster kubeconfig secret, the `openshift-online` org gate + allowlist values, and deploying/syncing the reaper onto the target cluster via hypershell-gitops.

**Handoff (ops, not code):**
1. **GitHub Actions secrets** (repo or a `pr-environments` environment): `OPENSHIFT_PR_ENV_SERVER_URL`, `OPENSHIFT_PR_ENV_TOKEN`, `PR_ENV_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `PR_ENV_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PR_ENV_GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`. **Vars:** `PR_ENV_GITHUB_ORG` (default `openshift-online`), `PR_ENV_GITHUB_ALLOWLIST`, `PR_ENV_RETAINED_MAX_HOURS` (default 72), `PR_ENV_UNRETAINED_MAX_HOURS` (default 24).
2. **CI service account on the cluster:** create/patch/delete projects, apply the overlay, patch namespaces, read Secrets in the `-keycloak` namespace; mint its token into `OPENSHIFT_PR_ENV_TOKEN`.
3. **GitHub OAuth App:** one App with a single stable callback URL; set the three OAuth secrets above.
4. **Sync the reaper into hypershell-gitops** (`clusters/hysh-aws-01/apps/pr-env-reaper`) from this repo's `deploy/e2e/reaper` reference copy after any reaper behavior/RBAC/schedule change.

**Wave plan:** W1-W5 delivered the first (continuous-deploy) slice. W6 (this run) re-shaped the workflow to the ephemeral-by-default spec: in-run teardown, `/pr-extend`/`/pr-destroy`, dual timebox, shared `openshift-down` teardown for the reaper, and comment lifetime wording.

## Wave Plan

### CGV-W1: Generated gateway configuration validation ✅

**Scope:** CGV-1 through CGV-4 (HYPERSHELL-179) | **Status:** Complete

1. Add `github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2` as a direct control-plane dependency (already an indirect dep in the repo root).
2. Render the gateway.toml artifact up front via the same `ApplyManifestToNamespace` + `ApplyConfigOverrides` path `deployGateway` uses (`RenderGatewayConfigTOML`).
3. Validate the rendered artifact for well-formed TOML and OIDC structural coherence (`ValidateRenderedGatewayConfig`), distinct from the existing input-field validation.
4. Gate before `deployGateway` so an invalid render writes no ConfigMap and never rolls the workload; a `Running` gateway keeps its last-good config.
5. Surface failures as `PhaseFailed` with a human-readable reason and a name+namespace log line via a typed `RenderedConfigValidationError` detected with `errors.As`.
6. Add unit tests for the validator, the renderer against the real base ConfigMap, and the error-unwrap contract; run build, vet, and the full control-plane test suite.

**CGV-W1 summary:** The control plane now validates the fully rendered
`gateway.toml` artifact before writing any config-derived resource. Well-formedness
is checked by parsing the artifact, and OIDC coherence is checked structurally
(section present with an issuer, unauthenticated access disabled). Because the gate
runs before `deployGateway`, an invalid render writes no ConfigMap and never rolls
the workload, so a running gateway keeps serving its last-good configuration; the
failure settles the gateway to the canonical `Failed` phase with a human-readable
reason and a name+namespace log line, reusing the existing phase vocabulary. Build,
vet, and the complete control-plane test suite pass.

### CP-OBS-RQ-W1: Reconcile queue metrics ✅

**Scope:** Changed CP-OBS-07 queue fields only | **Status:** Complete

1. Add the queue-depth observable gauge and queue-wait histogram.
2. Register one depth callback for each shared reconcile queue.
3. Track the first ready time for each pending key and record it when `Handle` starts.
4. Keep coalesced work as one sample and exclude scheduled retry backoff.
5. Verify metric units, attributes, buckets, queue behavior, build, vet, race tests, alignment, and review checks.

**CP-OBS-RQ-W1 summary:** The shared reconcile queue now exports ready depth
and ready-to-worker wait time through OTel. It keeps one ready time for
coalesced work. It moves the retry ready time to the end of scheduled backoff.
The queue does not allocate its telemetry state when metric export is disabled.
One locked worker-claim boundary removes a key from ready depth and stops its
queue-wait time. The eligibility time keeps scheduled retry backoff out of both
metrics, including after a dirty add.
Focused repeat tests, race tests, the complete control-plane tests, build, vet,
lint, alignment, and review checks pass.

### CP-OBS-GPD-W1: Reconcile Gateway provision-duration metrics ✅

**Scope:** Changed CP-OBS-07 fields only | **Status:** Complete

1. Add the histogram name, unit, description, and explicit buckets.
2. Use API server timestamps from the successful `Running` update response.
3. Record direct and delayed first promotions.
4. Exclude `Degraded` recoveries, including forced recovery retries.
5. Coordinate the two promotion paths so only one path records the observation.
6. Verify that the metric has no Gateway identifier attribute.

**CP-OBS-GPD-W1 summary:** The first implementation met the metric, timestamp, and transition contracts. The scoped reconcile found and closed one concurrent-recording gap. A per-Gateway claim now coordinates the event-driven and health paths. The direct path checks the stored phase before work starts. The retry adapter keeps the phase that existed before it bypasses the phase gate. Recovery and later desired-state work cannot look like a new provision. Package constants now keep the Gateway phase and healthy-status values consistent. Focused race tests pass.

### KC-ES-W1: Stop the Keycloak event storm

**Scope:** OI-7, SA-14
**Dependency:** Existing control-plane token provider and service-account Keycloak reconciliation
**Status:** Complete

1. Interpret the token response's `expires_in` value as seconds and keep the 80 percent refresh threshold.
2. Add a regression test that proves that repeated calls reuse one token.
3. Accept an empty default-scope list or one built-in `service_account` scope as converged.
4. Reject every other default scope and every optional scope as drift.
5. Add regression tests for the provider-managed scope and additional-scope drift.
6. Run control-plane tests, race tests, vet, build, alignment, and review checks.

**KC-ES-W1 summary:** The token provider now interprets `expires_in` as seconds and refreshes after 80 percent of the token lifetime. Service-account reconciliation now accepts Keycloak's built-in `service_account` scope without a write and repairs every other client scope. Sequential, concurrent, threshold, no-write, drift, and update-payload tests cover the changes. The complete control-plane test suite, affected-package race tests, vet, lint, build, alignment scan, and independent review passed.

### GC-W1: OpenShift Route support for the Gateway Console

**Scope:** GC-1, GC-5, GC-7, GC-9
**Dependency:** Existing Gateway Console and Route ingress implementations
**Status:** Complete

1. Select console exposure from the effective gateway ingress mode.
2. Create an edge-terminated OpenShift Route for `openshell-console` in Route mode.
3. Observe HTTPRoute acceptance or OpenShift Route admission for address publication.
4. Reconcile initial provisioning, health repair, inactive exposure removal, and teardown for both modes.
5. Add `routes/custom-host` controller RBAC.
6. Add unit tests for resource shape, readiness, mode selection, and cleanup.
7. Run control-plane build, vet, test, alignment, and review checks.

**GC-W1 summary:** Added an edge-terminated OpenShift Route for the console, selected readiness by ingress mode, removed inactive console exposures, aligned route-enable semantics, and added custom-host RBAC. The complete control-plane test suite, affected-package race tests, vet, lint, build, Kustomize renders, alignment scan, and independent review passed.

### HYPERSHELL-49 OpenShellGatewayServiceAccount waves

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| SA-W1 | Nested REST/OpenAPI contract with separate create/get/list models and no-store one-time response | Complete |
| SA-W2 | Extend generators for nested resources and regenerate Go/TypeScript SDKs | Complete |
| SA-W3 | Persistence, nested RBAC, synchronous Keycloak adapter, lifecycle/reconciliation, cleanup, audit, deployment wiring | Complete |
| SA-W4 | HyperShell CLI create/list/get/revoke/delete and secret-safe output | Complete |
| SA-W5 | Gateway-detail Service accounts tab, host adapter, local-only handoff, setup commands, management table | Complete |
| SA-W6 | Integration verification, alignment, review-guidance audit, and checkpoint closure | Complete |

Waves execute in this order because every later consumer depends on the public contract. Specs stay frozen. Generated SDK and CLI output is regenerated from OpenAPI rather than edited by hand.

**SA-W5 summary:** Added the gateway-detail `Service accounts` tab, URL-backed collection state, server-side search/filter/sort/pagination, capability-driven creation, one-time local credential handoff, safe OpenShell and Client Credentials command generation, repeatable non-secret setup, and revoke/delete management. The BFF preserves no-store response headers.

**SA-W6 summary:** Hardened concealment, lifecycle retries, orphan cleanup, Keycloak pagination, exact role/scope replacement, expiration enforcement, and gateway endpoint normalization. Verified changed Go packages with the race detector; verified all Go modules with `go vet`; and passed the complete web formatting, lint, type, architecture, localization, unit-coverage, production-build, Storybook, and BFF checks. The repository-wide API integration run remains dependent on a correctly credentialed local PostgreSQL instance.

### Wave 1-6: COMPLETED

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| W1 | StatefulSet → Deployment + PostgreSQL Backend | ✅ Complete |
| W2 | cert-manager TLS | ✅ Complete |
| W3 | OIDC + Trusted CA Bundle | ✅ Complete |
| W4 | Gateway API Routing (GRPCRoute + BackendTLSPolicy) | ✅ Complete |
| W5 | Gateway Proto Schema + API Fields | ✅ Complete |
| W6 | Gateway Deletion + Cleanup + Route Removal | ✅ Complete |

**Wave 5 summary:** Added 5 gateway provisioning fields (image, server_dns_names, route_address, oidc, route) across proto, OpenAPI, model, migration, presenters, and gRPC/HTTP handlers. Control plane reconciler populates GatewayConfig from proto fields. (`database_config` field added in W5 was superseded by CNPG ManagedDatabase integration in W8 and has been removed. Historical note: ManagedDatabase itself was removed on 2026-09-16; see the openshell-gateway-database.spec.md gap table.)

**Wave 6 summary:** Implemented `DeleteGatewayResources()` with label-based deletion of all namespaced resources + per-tenant ClusterRoleBinding cleanup. Added in-memory namespace cache for DELETED event handling (gRPC DELETE events have nil resource). Changed ClusterRoleBinding to per-tenant naming (`...-<namespace>`). Added `deleteGatewayAPIResources()` for route removal when routing disabled. ownerReferences deferred - explicit deletion covers the cleanup need.

### Wave 7: Cross-Cutting Fixes + Workload Restart Mechanism

**Scope:** G9, G11, G13, T5, T6, T7, O5, O7, R1, R7, R17
**Dependency:** Wave 5

1. Add `/tmp` emptyDir volume to `deployment.yaml`
2. Add `client_ca_path` to `[openshell.gateway.tls]` in `configmap.yaml`
3. Add `runAsNonRoot: true` to certgen job container SecurityContext
4. Add resource requests/limits to certgen job (cpu:50m/200m, memory:64Mi/128Mi)
5. Implement hash-annotation mechanism: compute SHA256 of ConfigMap + Secret data, annotate Deployment pod template → triggers rolling restart on config/cert changes
6. Apply `jwks_ttl` default (3600) when value is 0 in `ApplyConfigOverrides()`
7. Block gateway deployment when cert-manager is absent (not just WARN)
8. Add SAN change detection (compare ConfigMap `server_sans` to API `serverDnsNames`)
9. Fix router NetworkPolicy: use `podSelector` with gateway label; only create when `route` config present
10. ~~DNS label validation~~ Not needed: shortened namespace (26 chars) + `gw-` prefix keeps all derived names under 63 chars
11. Verify: `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`

### Wave 8: CNPG Integration + Per-Tenant Gateway API Resources + routeAddress

**Scope:** D1-D11, D-SR updates, G18, R3, R6, R9, R12, R13, R15, R16, R18
**Dependency:** Wave 5, Wave 6

**Wave 8 partial summary (d1fc36b) - historical; the ManagedDatabase resource and CNPG path were later removed (2026-09-16 re-baseline in the openshell-gateway-database.spec.md gap table):** CNPG operator integration complete: ManagedDatabaseReconciler (Cluster CRs), GatewayReconciler (DatabaseRole/Database/Secret CRs), ManagedDatabase deletion protection, gateway fleet/database auto-resolution, CNPG operator detection, credential rotation updated to CNPG Secret approach (no ALTER ROLE). `database_config` field removed from API, SDK, CLI (pb.go + OpenAPI models still need `make proto` + `make generate`). Items R12, R13, R15, R16, R18 (routing) and G18 remain pending.

Remaining routing items:
1. ~~Require `GATEWAY_API_GATEWAY_NAME` env var~~ R3: already Present
2. ~~GRPCRoute parentRef with sectionName~~ R9: already Present
3. Fix hostname convention: `gw-<ns>.<base-domain>` (shortened prefix)
4. Derive routeAddress deterministically from hostname, PATCH to API server via gRPC
5. Per-tenant K8s Gateway resource (R12)
6. Wildcard cert copy `grpc-gateway-certs` to tenant namespace (R13)
7. Wait for Gateway Accepted+Programmed (R16)
8. Add `kindToResource` mapping for Gateway kind (R18)
9. Verify: `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`

### Wave E2E-W1: Deploy Base/Overlay + Image Overrides ✅

**Scope:** E2E-5, E2E-7, E2E-8 | **Status:** Complete

Moved shared manifests to `deploy/base/`, created kustomize overlays for Kind and OpenShift, added IMAGE_TAG override support in `up.sh`, verified `kustomize build` for all overlays.

### Wave E2E-W2: E2E Test Framework + Kind Driver ✅

**Scope:** E2E-1, E2E-2a-e, E2E-3 | **Status:** Complete

Created `tests/e2e/lib.sh` (shared utilities), `tests/e2e/drivers/kind.sh` (5 driver functions), `tests/e2e/e2e-openshell.sh` (infra-agnostic test adapted from `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh`). Driver validation at startup with available driver listing.

### Wave E2E-W3: CI E2E Workflow ✅

**Scope:** E2E-4, E2E-5, E2E-6 | **Status:** Complete

Created `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` with PR/push/merge_group triggers, concurrency groups, component detection (api_server, control_plane, e2e, pr_test), Kind cluster creation, e2e test execution, failure-only diagnostic artifacts, 20-min timeout, summary gate. Added `e2e` component to `.github/component-paths.json`.

### Wave PERF-W1: Performance harness + short/long mode ✅

**Scope:** E2E-9, PERF-1..PERF-10 | **Status:** Complete

Added `E2E_MODE=short|long` step tagging in `e2e-openshell.sh` (long remains the default, so CI is unchanged). Added `tests/e2e/perf/lib.sh` (timing, average/percentile latency, bounded concurrency, schema_version=1 JSON I/O), `tests/e2e/e2e-performance.sh` (batched scale-up, canary checkpoints, functional gate, SLO, signal-safe EXIT cleanup), `scripts/perf-report.sh`, and `make e2e-performance` / `make e2e-performance-report`. Batch workers emit periodic stage/count/elapsed heartbeats while concurrent provisioning is in progress. Teardown deletes the run's Gateway records and directly reaps their tracked namespaces under one global timeout, including on INT/TERM, rather than depending on periodic namespace GC. The default per-gateway provisioning timeout is 180 seconds. `make e2e` now honors `E2E_INFRA_DRIVER` instead of hardcoding `kind`. Verified with `bash -n` and `tests/e2e/perf/lib_test.sh` (no cluster required).

**Update (#332):** `E2E_MODE` was subsequently refactored from two modes (`short`/`long`) to three (`short`, `long`, `perf`). `short` is now the clean self-contained lifecycle gate (no multi-identity, single-owned gateway); the old `short` characteristics (canary reuse, multi-identity) moved to `perf`, which is only used by `e2e-performance.sh`. `long` remains the default. See E2E-9 gap table row for updated description.

### Wave OS-W1: Manual OpenShift e2e/performance driver (partial) ✅

Implemented `tests/e2e/drivers/openshift.sh` for an already-deployed environment: namespace-scoped API and Keycloak Route discovery, Gateway API endpoint/readiness checks, gateway base-domain discovery from the running controller Deployment, `oc` selection, shared per-gateway Keycloak role flows, and TLS verification through the system trust store or an extracted private CA. The shared suite now routes direct HTTP calls through the driver TLS seam. Manual runs require only the current `oc` context and `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE`. No OpenShift cluster lifecycle, namespace creation, overlay reconciliation, bootstrap, or CI automation is included.

### Wave OS-W2: OpenShift local-dev lifecycle (up/down/swap) ✅

Implemented `scripts/cluster/` with a driver model. `make kind-*` wraps today's `scripts/kind/` with no behavior change. `make openshift-up` deploys `kustomize build deploy/openshift/` into an ephemeral namespace group (`OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` + `${OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE}-keycloak`), stamps ownership labels, refuses foreign namespaces, fails fast when the shared Gateway is missing, reads the gateway base domain from that Gateway's listener hostname, seeds ManagedCluster/GatewayRelease/ManagedDatabase/Gateway, and prints Routes. `make openshift-down` deletes only owned namespaces. Component swaps (`make openshift-api-server-up` and siblings) build, push an immutable commit+namespace identity to the internal registry, record per-namespace state in `.openshift-swaps/`, and are preserved across reconcile. Overlay: web-console + Keycloak Routes; SCC *use* is namespace-scoped RoleBindings. E2E, CI, `pr-test` consolidation, and overlay drift CI were explicitly out of scope.

### Wave R1-R8: RBAC COMPLETED

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| WR1 | Data Model Foundation (users, roles, roleBindings plugins, 6 built-in roles) | ✅ Complete |
| WR2 | API Surface (handlers, presenters, routes for roles + roleBindings) | ✅ Complete |
| WR3 | User Auto-Provisioning + Fleet Bootstrap (middleware + fleet:owner binding) | ✅ Complete |
| WR4 | Authorization Middleware (scope-aware evaluation, exempt endpoints, enforcement flag) | ✅ Complete |
| WR6 | gRPC Authorization (unary + stream interceptors with lazy init) | ✅ Complete |
| WR7 | Integration Tests (roles: 4 tests, roleBindings: 7 tests) | ✅ Complete |
| WR8 | Security Hardening (12 PR review findings resolved) | ✅ Complete |

**Wave R1 summary:** Created `plugins/users/`, `plugins/roles/`, `plugins/roleBindings/` plugins with models, migrations, DAOs, services. Seeded 6 built-in roles with permissions JSONB and hierarchy levels (0=platform:admin, 1=fleet:owner, 2=fleet:editor/platform:viewer, 3=fleet:viewer/gateway:viewer).

**Wave R2 summary:** Added OpenAPI specs (`openapi.roles.yaml`, `openapi.role_bindings.yaml`), handlers (roles: read-only List/Get; roleBindings: Create/List/Get/Delete), presenters, route registration. Updated openapi_embed_test.go operation count from 31 to 37.

**Wave R3 summary:** `UserProvisioningMiddleware` upserts User from JWT claims (username, email, name) on every authenticated request. `fleetBootstrapper.CreateOwnerBinding` creates fleet:owner RoleBinding atomically in same DB transaction as fleet creation. Central `plugins/rbac/plugin.go` wires middleware on apiV1Router.

**Wave R4 summary:** `rbacAuthzMiddleware` implements `auth.AuthorizationMiddleware` with scope-aware evaluation: loads caller's RoleBindings via `FindBindingsByUserID`, matches against resource scope extracted from URL. Exempt endpoints: POST /fleets, GET /metadata, GET /openapi. Service caller bypass via ClientID detection. Error opacity: 404 for unauthorized singleton GETs, 403 for mutations. `RBAC_ENFORCE=true` env var controls enforcement.

**Wave R6 summary:** `RBACUnaryInterceptor` and `RBACStreamInterceptor` apply same scope-aware evaluation to gRPC calls. `lazyRBACInterceptor` with `sync.Once` resolves services on first call (registered at init time via `RegisterPostAuthGRPC*Interceptor`). `provisionUserForGRPC` extracts JWT payload and provisions user before authorization.

**Wave R7 summary:** Integration tests for roles (TestRoleListReturnsBuiltInRoles, TestRoleGetById, TestRoleGetNotFound, TestRoleListUnauthenticated) and roleBindings (TestRoleList, TestRoleGet, TestRoleBindingCreate, TestRoleBindingDelete, TestRoleBindingList, TestRoleBindingScopeValidation, TestFleetCreationCreatesOwnerBinding).

**Wave R8 summary:** Resolved 12 PR review security findings. Blockers: (1) gRPC interceptor now evaluates bindings against method type via `isGRPCAuthorized` instead of blanket pass-through; (2) RoleBinding Create enforces strictly-below hierarchy with platform:admin exception via `validateHierarchy`. Majors: (3) `matchesFleetRole` fixed `fleet:editor` DELETE bug (`|| true` removed); (4) gateway-scoped bindings now compare `b.GatewayID` against request `gatewayID`; (5) `isExemptEndpoint` now exempts GET /roles and GET /roles/{id}; (6) gateway scope validation rejects `fleet_id` (exactly one FK); (7) last-owner protection uses `NewNonBlockingLock` advisory lock to prevent races. Verified: fleet owner bootstrap IS atomic via framework `TransactionMiddleware`. Added 24 unit tests (`pkg/rbac/`) + 5 new integration tests. All admin seeding references removed from spec and RECONCILE.md.

### Wave KC-W1: Keycloak Client Provisioning + OIDC Auto-Population ✅

**Scope:** KC-1, KC-2, KC-3, KC-4, KC-6, KC-8, KC-9 | **Status:** Complete

Created `keycloak/client.go` with full Admin REST API client (token cache with 80% TTL refresh, client CRUD, role/mapper provisioning, atomic rollback). Read `hypershell-keycloak-admin` Secret at CP startup. `reconcileKeycloakClient()` provisions OIDC client with PKCE, fullScopeAllowed=false, openshell-admin/openshell-user roles, audience/sub/client-roles mappers. Auto-populates Gateway `oidc` field via `UpdateOIDC` callback. Keycloak client deleted on Gateway deletion. OpenAPI `oidc` field marked `readOnly: true`.

### Wave KC-W2: OIDC Role Bridge (RoleBinding Event Handling) ✅

**Scope:** KC-5, RBAC-7 | **Status:** Complete

Added `role_bindings.proto` with `WatchRoleBindings` RPC. Created `grpc_handler.go` and `grpc_presenter.go` in roleBindings plugin with role name enrichment via RoleService. Added `WatchRoleBindings` to watcher package. Created `RoleBindingReconciler` that maps gateway:owner→openshell-admin, gateway:viewer→openshell-user and calls `keycloak.AssignClientRole`/`RemoveClientRole`. 7th watch stream launched conditionally when Keycloak is configured. Added `GetUnscoped` to DAO/service for soft-deleted event handling.

### Wave KC-W3: Gateway Visibility Scoping (Per-Query DAO Filtering) ✅

**Scope:** KC-7, RBAC-2 (list filtering) | **Status:** Complete

Added `FindGatewayIDsByUserID` DAO method (distinct gateway_id from role_bindings). Created `GatewayVisibilityFilter` interface and `rbac.NewGatewayVisibilityFilter` adapter. Gateway List handler filters results by accessible gateway IDs when user is authenticated. Singleton GET returns 404 for unauthorized gateways (unchanged, already in RBAC middleware).

### Wave SR-W1: Database Password Rotation ✅

**Scope:** SR-1, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-8 | **Status:** Complete

Added `database/sql` + `lib/pq` to control plane. `rotateDatabaseCredentials()` checks `rotate-db-credentials` annotation vs `last-db-rotation` on Secret; generates 32-byte hex password via crypto/rand; connects to PostgreSQL and executes `ALTER ROLE`; updates Secret with new password+URL; sets `last-db-rotation` annotation. ALTER ROLE before Secret update for safety. `applyConfigHashAnnotation` now includes `openshell-gateway-db-credentials` Secret. Wired into `ReconcileGateway` after `reconcileDatabaseCredentials()`.

### Wave NGC + S1-S4: Namespace GC + Event-Driven Sandbox Count ✅

**Scope:** NGC-1..NGC-6, SC-1..SC-6 | **Status:** Complete

**Namespace GC (NGC):** `NamespaceGCReconciler` sweeps managed namespaces (both
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=hypershell-control-plane` and
`hypershell.redhat.io/managed=true` required, plus
`hypershell.redhat.io/instance=<HYPERSHELL_NAMESPACE>`) and reaps those orphaned
past the grace period. Each sweep first claims unlabeled legacy gateway
namespaces (management labels, no instance label, `openshell-*` not
`openshell-db-*`) so missed-delete orphans from before the instance label are
not invisible to GC. Grace timer persisted on the `hypershell.redhat.io/gc-eligible-since`
annotation (RFC3339) and cleared when a Gateway reappears. Sweep aborts entirely
if Gateways cannot be listed, so a transient API failure never reaps a live
namespace. A `GarbageCollected` Event is recorded in the control-plane namespace
before deletion. Env-configurable (`GATEWAY_NAMESPACE_GC_ENABLED`/`_INTERVAL`/
`_GRACE_PERIOD`, defaults true/5m/10m). Delete-driven cleanup deletes the
namespace (cascading in-namespace resources incl. sandbox pods) and explicitly
reaps out-of-namespace state (ClusterRoleBinding, Keycloak client, cross-namespace
credential RBAC).

**Sandbox Count (S1-S4):** Migrated active-sandbox accounting from a periodic
full-namespace pod LIST (previously in the health reconciler) to an event-driven
label-selected pod informer.
- **S1:** `AdjustActiveSandboxCount(namespace, delta)` and
  `SetActiveSandboxCount(namespace, count)` gRPC RPCs with atomic single-column
  SQL, floored at zero, NULL-as-zero, `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard. `active_sandbox_count`
  made a nullable `*int` column, OpenAPI `readOnly`, excluded from patch.
- **S2:** `SandboxCountReconciler`: informer on `agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash`;
  increments/decrements on active-set transitions; `synced` gate suppresses the
  initial-LIST add burst; periodic `selfHeal` sets the absolute count from the cache
  for every gateway namespace (drift-to-zero + post-restart recovery). Legacy
  `openshell.ai/managed-by=openshell` sandbox label dropped from code and spec.
  Health reconciler's sandbox-counting block removed. Full unit-test suite
  (`sandboxcount_test.go`) incl. a `-race` concurrency test.
- **S3:** Non-sortable "Active sandboxes" console column adjacent to the gateway
  name; unset renders the localized not-available fallback (NULL→N/A, 0→"0").
  New reusable-package message re-extracted into web-console's `en.json`.
- **S4:** Verified: control-plane `go build`/`vet`/`test -race` clean, golangci-lint
  0 issues (control-plane + api-server gateways plugin), reusable UI package and
  web-console `check` green. (api-server unit tests run on CI; the local
  Apple-Silicon go-m1cpu cgo crash at package init is environmental.)

### Wave GPT-W2: Histogram Provision Time (mean / P50 / P95)

**Scope:** GPT-00 through GPT-08 (v2 spec), OP-DASH-13 three-row system-summary, OP-DASH-19 independent source
**Dependency:** CP-OBS-GPD-W1 ✅; `gateway-provision-time.spec.md` v2; Prometheus pipeline for CP histogram (GPT-00)
**Status:** Planned

1. Wire control-plane OTLP metrics into Prometheus (`gateway_provision_duration_seconds`) in deploy/kind (GPT-00)
2. Add BFF `GET /api/metrics/gateway-provision-duration` with mean / P50 / P95 PromQL (GPT-03, GPT-04)
3. Decouple adapter: new `gateway-provision-duration` metric source; remove list-based computation (GPT-06)
4. Extend `OperationalMetric` with `provisionDuration`; map BFF JSON to `provision-time` metric (GPT-01, GPT-05)
5. Render three system-summary rows (mean, median, P95) with localized labels (GPT-05, OP-DASH-13)
6. BFF + adapter unit tests; update `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `dashboard-metric-sources.ts`

### Future (Deferred)

| # | Item | Domain | Reason |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| RBAC-5 | Platform Admin Bootstrap | Security | First admin created via DB migration; no CLI by design |
| G2 | Shared Kustomize Library + CLI | Gateway | Architectural; needs design |
| G17 | SSH Payload Delivery | Gateway | New feature; needs design |
| D13 | Database Field Immutability | DB | API server validation |
| D14 | Gateway Deletion Protection | DB | API server validation |
| D12 | DROP COLUMN migration for `database_config` | DB | Column still in DB schema; destructive migration deferred |
| O6 | Custom raw TOML `config` field | OIDC | Advanced; not blocking |
| SR-5 | KEK Rotation | Secret Rotation | Requires gateway re-encryption API (Day-2) |
| SR-7 | Provider Credential Rotation | Secret Rotation | Platform-managed (K8s SA, Vault); no CP action needed |
| DM-4 | Gateway `status` writeback | Data Model | Depends on CP-4 |
| lib/pq dead dep | `lib/pq` in go.mod but not imported | CP | Run `go mod tidy` in control-plane to remove dead dependency |
| DM-5 | Canary release logic | Data Model | GatewayReleaseReconciler is stub |
| DM-6 | Network mesh logic | Data Model | GatewayNetworkReconciler is stub |
| CP-4 | Status synchronization / health checks | CP | Needs periodic reconcile loop |
| CP-5 | Multi-cluster client pool | CP | Architecture: per-cluster kubeconfig |
| LD-* | Local development (most items) | Local Dev | Spec recently authored; MVP first |
| WEB-AUTH-* | OIDC BFF + session + CSRF | Web Console | Implemented in OIDC wave; 3 minor follow-ups remain |

### Cross-Cutting Findings

1. **Stale `statefulset.yaml`**: `manifests/gateway/statefulset.yaml` exists but is unreferenced (uses SQLite). Should be removed.
2. **Naming: Sector vs Fleet**: Spec now uses "Fleet" (aligned with code). No longer a gap.
3. **No restart mechanism (cross-spec)**: TLS, OIDC, and Routing specs all require workload restart on config changes. Addressed in Wave 7 via hash annotation.
4. **Label-based cleanup (cross-spec)**: Database and Routing specs updated to use `hypershell.redhat.io/managed` label-based deletion instead of ownerReferences. ownerReferences were infeasible (DB resources created before Deployment) and unnecessary given explicit cleanup in `DeleteGatewayResources()`.
5. ~~**Config-hash missing DB credentials**~~: Resolved in SR-W1. `applyConfigHashAnnotation` now includes `openshell-gateway-db-credentials` Secret.
6. ~~**RoleBinding watcher missing**~~: Resolved in KC-W2. CP now watches 7 resource types (added RoleBindings via `WatchRoleBindings` gRPC stream).

### Wave HELM: Helm Adoption (Shell-Out Implementation Complete)

**Scope:** Shift from static YAML manifests to Helm-based gateway deployment (openshell-gateway-helm-adoption.spec.md)

**Status:** Foundation complete - Using shell-out approach instead of Go SDK

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `internal/helm/` package with chart validation, values mapping, and shell client wrapper
- ✅ Added Helm configuration env vars to `internal/config/config.go`
- ✅ Created `charts/VERSION` file (0.4.0)
- ✅ Resolved dependency conflicts by using `helm` CLI instead of Go SDK
- ✅ Implemented `ShellClient` with install/uninstall/upgrade/status operations
- ✅ Verified build: `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` pass
- ✅ Documented decision in `.claude/helm-dependency-resolution-decision.md`

**Pending:**
- ⏸️ Refactor `ReconcileGateway` to use Helm install instead of `deployGateway`
- ⏸️ Add Helm uninstall to `DeleteGatewayResources`
- ⏸️ Remove obsolete code (manifests.go, manifest loading, inline cert-manager/credential/routing reconciliation)
- ⏸️ Update Dockerfile to embed Helm chart
- ⏸️ Verify integration tests in dev-cluster

**Decision:** Shell-out to `helm` CLI instead of using Helm Go SDK
- **Why:** Helm SDK has irreconcilable k8s.io version conflicts (needs v0.27, we need v0.36+)
- **Approach:** Execute `helm install/uninstall/status` via `exec.Command`
- **Benefits:** No dependency conflicts, production-ready, simple implementation
- **Runtime Requirement:** `helm` binary must be in PATH

**Files Created:**
- `internal/helm/chart.go` - Chart path validation and OCI pull helper
- `internal/helm/values.go` - Gateway config → Helm values mapping (13 value categories, 189 LOC)
- `internal/helm/shell_client.go` - Helm CLI wrapper (install/uninstall/upgrade/status, 280 LOC)
- `charts/VERSION` - Chart version declaration (0.4.0)
- `.claude/helm-dependency-resolution-decision.md` - Decision rationale and implementation plan

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added 5 Helm-related env vars
- `go.mod` - NO Helm SDK dependency (using shell exec instead)

| Date | Commit | Action | Coverage | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| 2026-09-22 | `5e14f29b` | RECONCILE.md checkpoint update: registered 6 new spec files, updated E2E-9 for 3-mode split, added E2E-13 (macOS CLI container), DM-3g/h/i (new Gateway fields), OS-14/OS-15 (openshift-seed/test) | 84% (analyzed rows unchanged; 6 new specs pending full analysis) | Codebase commit advanced from `464ec5e` to `5e14f29b`. New specs from commits: `85927b3c` (gateway-provision-outcomes, gateway-release-distribution), `be0bf2ea` (gateway-fleet-total-trend, gateway-sandbox-active-trends, hub-cluster-utilization-trends), `630a5ed1` (openshell-branch-build - spec only, 0% implemented). |
| 2026-09-22 | `5e14f29b` | Registered E2E-9 three-mode refactor (#332) and macOS CLI container wrapper (#335) | E2E Testing 100% (unchanged; new requirements Present) | E2E_MODE `perf` split from old `short`; `e2e-performance.sh` uses `perf`; `short` is now a safe standalone gate. macOS runs openshell CLI via socat container on Kind network. |
| 2026-09-17 | `85927b3c` | Gateway provision reliability, release distribution, user adoption metrics (HYPERSHELL-280) | New specs added; provisionally Present | `gateway-provision-outcomes.spec.md` + `gateway-release-distribution.spec.md` authored and code delivered: BFF Prometheus proxy routes, provision-reliability widget + chart, release-distribution aggregation + chart, CP outcome counter, fleet-wide RBAC for dashboard operators. |
| 2026-09-18 | `be0bf2ea` | Trend sparklines for fleet and hub metrics (HYPERSHELL-281) | New specs added; provisionally Present | `gateway-fleet-total-trend.spec.md`, `gateway-sandbox-active-trends.spec.md`, `hub-cluster-utilization-trends.spec.md` authored and code delivered: BFF range-query infrastructure (`prometheus-range-query.ts`), range extensions to cluster metric routes, sandbox-status chart, fleet trend sparklines in layout template. |
| 2026-09-21 | `630a5ed1` | OpenShell branch build spec added (#148) - spec only | 0% (no implementation) | `openshell-branch-build.spec.md` authored: `make kind-openshell-up` workflow, `OPENSHELL_BRANCH`/`OPENSHELL_PR`/`OPENSHELL_REPO` vars, `openshell-dev-gateway` provisioning, coexistence with `dev-gateway`, `sandbox_image`/`dev_build`/`dev_build_metadata` Gateway schema fields. Also added `openshift-seed` (OS-14) and `openshift-test` (OS-15) requirements to `openshift-development.spec.md`. |
| 2026-09-07 | working tree | Reconciled gateway-reconcile-concurrency.spec.md (CP-CONC-01..03) | 3/3 scoped requirements present | Made the gateway reconcile worker-pool size deployment configuration via `GATEWAY_RECONCILE_WORKERS` (new `getEnvInt` helper + `Config.GatewayReconcileWorkers`, default 4 = prior hardcoded pool), plumbed config -> `WatchGateways` -> `withWorkers`, clamped non-positive to the default at the watcher boundary (preserving the test-only 0-worker queue pattern), and added config/getEnvInt tests. Per-gateway serialization and bounded throttle already held (existing queue tests). The full-corpus percentage is unchanged. |
| 2026-09-04 | `bd02232` | Reanalyzed CP-OBS-RQ-W1 after review fixes | 5/5 scoped fields present | Defined one locked worker-claim boundary for depth and wait, kept dirty adds in backoff out of ready depth, and made the design rationale apply to each shared reconcile queue. The full-corpus percentage is unchanged. |
| 2026-09-04 | `9c01984` | Completed CP-OBS-RQ-W1 reconcile-queue metrics | 5/5 scoped fields present | Added ready queue depth and ready-to-worker wait metrics with one bounded resource-kind attribute. Coalesced work produces one wait observation, and scheduled retry backoff is excluded. |
| 2026-09-04 | `e61bdac` | Planned the CP-OBS-07 reconcile-queue metric delta | 0/5 scoped fields present | Found two missing instruments and three missing behavior checks. Planned one control-plane wave for queue depth, queue wait, bounded labels, coalescing, and retry-backoff exclusion. |
| 2026-09-03 | `b97a99d` | Reconciled the CP-OBS-07 Gateway provision-duration delta | 5/5 scoped fields present | Found and closed a duplicate-observation race between the event-driven and health promotion paths. Added a concurrent claim, stored-phase and forced-recovery checks, shared package constants, delete cleanup, timestamp tests, bucket tests, and a no-attribute test. The full-corpus percentage is unchanged. |
| 2026-08-31 | working tree | Completed Keycloak event-storm KC-ES-W1 | 82% | Corrected the token lifetime unit, reused tokens until the 80 percent threshold, accepted the provider-managed service-account scope, rejected all other client scopes, and added regression tests. OI-7 and SA-14 are present. |
| 2026-08-31 | 9ac4354 | Keycloak event-storm scoped gap analysis | 82% | Found two partial requirements: the token cache uses nanoseconds for `expires_in`, and service-account convergence rejects Keycloak's built-in scope. Planned control-plane wave KC-ES-W1. |
| 2026-08-27 | 9984ed0 | Completed Gateway Console GC-W1 | 82% | Added mode-selected Route exposure, admission readiness, lifecycle cleanup, custom-host RBAC, and tests. All nine console requirements are present. |

| 2026-09-01 | feecbcb, da771fb | Reconciled commit-driven stale doc gaps | 84% (unchanged) | Two recent commits removed hardcoded image defaults (`GATEWAY_IMAGE`/`GATEWAY_SUPERVISOR_IMAGE` now required env vars, no fallback) and unified deploy paths (deleted `components/api-server/deploy/*`, using repo-root `deploy/` as single source of truth). Updated 7 docs: `skills/deploy/ibm-cluster/SKILL.md` (image refs, path, namespace, image-var explanation), `skills/deploy/gcp-cluster/SKILL.md` (path fix, RBAC ref), `skills/deploy/deploy-cluster/SKILL.md` (full rewrite: Keycloak bootstrap, `hypershell-api-config` Secret creation, CNPG database, OIDC/JWT security, troubleshooting for missing Secret), `skills/tooling/update-openshell/SKILL.md` (grep patterns for new image names, search path fixes), `skills/RECONCILE.md` (skill directory tree, this log entry), `README.md` (env var rows, namespace refs), `specs/platform/openshift-development.spec.md` (deploy/ directory layout, overlay limitations note). Overlay gaps surfaced: `deploy/openshift/` requires manually-created `hypershell-api-config` Secret (missing from repo; documented in deploy-cluster), hardcoded domain placeholder, missing Keycloak Route on OpenShift. Marked as known limitations in specs. |

All `operational-dashboard-ui` and adapter tests pass. Operational dashboard 20/20 present. |
| 2026-09-09 | `21f02a0` | Scoped reanalysis of e2e-testing + local-development for the new OpenShift E2E CI content | E2E Testing 100% -> 95% (1 deferred) | The HYPERSHELL-240 docs commit added `E2E_OIDC_GRANT`, the merge-queue Kind CI gate, and OpenShift-driver contract wording. Verified in code: OpenShift driver unified with Kind (#232/#244), `configure/restore_namespace_gc_timing`, `merge_group` gate in `e2e.yml` (per-component `on-merge-queue-<sha>` waits, browser-trace skip), and `.tekton/*-merge-queue.yaml` are all implemented (E2E-10/11/12 present). Only gap is D-E2E-OIDC: driver token fns hardcode `grant_type=password`; the `client_credentials`+token-exchange path is owned by `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (out of scope) and flagged as a divergence pending a scope decision. No code changed this pass. |
| 2026-09-16 | working tree | HYPERSHELL-240 W6: ephemeral-by-default + `/pr-extend`/`/pr-destroy` | Ephemeral PR Environments 91% -> 100% | Spec shifted from keep-for-life-of-PR to deploy/test/destroy unless retained. **W6:** in-run teardown after Tests / E2E / OpenShift (does not mask e2e); `/pr-extend`/`/pr-destroy` command workflow (GitHub write check, latest authorized comment wins, `pr-environment/pr-extended` label cache); dual `expires-at` (`PR_ENV_RETAINED_MAX_HOURS` vs `PR_ENV_UNRETAINED_MAX_HOURS`); reaper and `make openshift-down` share `teardown-pr-env.sh`; access comment advertises `/pr-extend` and never implies an unretained env persists. `make ci-test` 10/10. Remaining ops handoff: GitHub OAuth App secrets, CI SA token, sync reaper into hypershell-gitops. |
| 2026-09-11 | working tree | PR-ENV-8 org-gate via BFF (no custom Keycloak image) | Ephemeral PR Environments 86% -> 91% | Enforced GitHub org membership / allowlist in the web-console BFF after OIDC callback. Denied users get no HyperShell session, so the BFF never forwards an API bearer. Kind stays ungated (`GITHUB_ORG_GATE` unset). No Keycloak SPI/custom image. |
| 2026-09-09 | working tree | HYPERSHELL-240 W2 made declarative (config-as-data) | Ephemeral PR Environments 86% (unchanged) | Replaced the imperative post-boot admin-API script with env-gated realm data. `deploy/base/keycloak/keycloak.yaml` now carries the GitHub IdP (`enabled: ${PR_ENV_GITHUB_IDP_ENABLED:false}`), the two hardcoded-role `identityProviderMappers` (`platform:admin`+`gateway:creator`), the `github.org.gate`/`github.username.allowlist` realm attributes, and `hypershell-e2e` `secret: ${HYPERSHELL_E2E_CLIENT_SECRET:e2e-secret}`, all resolved at import from the optional `hypershell-github-oauth` Secret wired into the Keycloak Deployment as `optional: true` secretKeyRefs. Kind/local/stage have no Secret, so every placeholder resolves to its default and the realm is inert (IdP off, secret `e2e-secret`) - consistent with the realm already leaving unresolved `${client_id}` mappers literal. Deleted `scripts/ci/configure-github-broker.sh`; the workflow now provisions the Secret (per-PR random e2e secret, masked) into the `-keycloak` namespace *before* `openshift-up` and fails closed on missing OAuth cfg; `read-e2e-client-secret.sh` reads `hypershell-github-oauth/e2e-client-secret`. Validated: realm JSON parses, `kustomize build deploy/base/keycloak` + `deploy/openshift` render, yamllint + `make ci-test` (21/21) clean. **One gate before merge:** Kind smoke test that Keycloak resolves `${VAR:default}` (blast radius = realm import) - recorded in the handoff. |
| 2026-09-09 | working tree | HYPERSHELL-240 waves W2-W4: PR-env CI workflow, reaper, GitHub broker | Ephemeral PR Environments 14% -> 86% | **W3:** added `.github/workflows/pr-environment.yml` (origin-only `pull_request` open/reopen/synchronize/closed, per-PR concurrency, unconditional `openshift-up`, Konflux gate + digest swap, e2e with `E2E_OIDC_GRANT=client_credentials`, one marked access comment, `openshift-down` on close) + helper scripts `scripts/ci/{pr-env-lib,stamp-pr-env,swap-openshift-images-by-digest,read-e2e-client-secret,upsert-pr-comment}.sh`. **W4:** `scripts/ci/reap-pr-environments.sh` + `deploy/e2e/reaper/` CronJob/RBAC (expires-at match predicate, deletes expired `pr-*` groups only). **W2 (partial):** `scripts/ci/configure-github-broker.sh` fails closed on missing OAuth cfg, upserts the GitHub IdP (`read:org`, no RH SSO), grants `platform:admin`+`gateway:creator` on broker login, publishes the per-PR `hypershell-e2e` secret; org/allowlist ENFORCEMENT authenticator + developer-principal impersonation handed off (need Keycloak SPI + live cluster). Pure logic unit-tested: `make ci-test` 21/21 (`pr-env-lib` 19, reaper 2); `openshift_driver_test` still 20/20; yamllint + kustomize clean. Registered `scripts/ci/**`, `deploy/e2e/**`, `deploy/openshift/**`, `pr-environment.yml` under the `e2e` component. Handoff list recorded above. |
| 2026-09-09 | working tree | Began HYPERSHELL-240 (ephemeral-pr-environments) reconcile: W1 + W5 | Ephemeral PR Environments 0% -> 14% | Re-scoped to implement `ephemeral-pr-environments.spec.md` (greenfield). **W1 (PR-ENV-10 code):** made the driver token functions grant-agnostic (`E2E_OIDC_GRANT` password\|client_credentials; admin client-credentials on `hypershell-e2e`; developer Keycloak token-exchange impersonation targeting the requested audience), added `E2E_OIDC_GRANT`/`E2E_OIDC_SA_CLIENT_ID`/`E2E_OIDC_SA_CLIENT_SECRET` defaults, added the `hypershell-e2e` confidential client + service account (platform:admin+gateway:creator, `hypershell-frontend` audience mapper, standard token exchange) to the base realm, and extended `openshift_driver_test.sh` (20/20, no cluster). **W5 (PR-ENV-11):** deprecation header on `components/pr-test/e2e-openshell.sh` + DEVELOPMENT.md pointer to the shared harness; ROKS/GCP + `pr_test` CI wiring untouched. **Remaining (need live OpenShift + a GitHub OAuth App to validate):** W2 realm GitHub-brokering overlay (IdP, org gate + allowlist, dev principal, impersonation perms), W3 the PR-environment CI workflow (identity, CD lifecycle, digest swap, e2e, comment, trust boundary), W4 timebox annotation + out-of-band reaper. |
| 2026-08-25 | working tree | Helm adoption foundation (Wave HELM partial) | ~74% | Created internal/helm/ package with shell-out implementation (chart validation, values mapping, shell client wrapper); added 5 Helm env vars to config; created charts/VERSION (0.4.0); documented shell-out decision rationale. Resolution: Use `helm` CLI via exec.Command instead of Go SDK to avoid k8s.io version conflicts. Builds successfully. Pending: reconciler refactoring, Dockerfile updates, manifest removal, integration tests. |
